jurisdictions.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 2: Governance</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent:

system, other relevant public interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

to participants and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is involved in activities with a more- complex risk profile or that is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, the default of the two participants and their affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure to the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions. All other CCPs should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure to the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 5: Collateral</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI that requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure should accept collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks. An FMI should also set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 6: Margin</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP should cover its credit exposures to its participants for all products through an effective margin system that is risk-based and regularly reviewed.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Principle 7: Liquidity risk</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk.

However, if not properly managed, they can pose significant risks to the financial system and be a potential source of contagion, particularly in periods of market stress. Although FMIs performed well during the recent financial crisis, events highlighted important lessons for effective risk management. These lessons, along with the experience of implementing the existing international standards, led the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to review and update the standards for FMIs.</a>1<span class="p"> This review was also conducted in support of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) initiative to strengthen core financial infrastructures and markets.

In general, these standards are expressed as broad principles in recognition of FMIs’ differing organisations, functions, and designs, and the different ways to achieve a particular result. In some cases, the principles also incorporate a specific minimum requirement (such as in the credit, liquidity, and general business risk principles) to ensure a common base level of risk management across FMIs and countries. In addition to standards for FMIs, the report outlines the general responsibilities of central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities for FMIs in implementing these standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark8">&zwnj;</a>Background<a name="bookmark30">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="1.3."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark32" class="a">FMIs play a critical role in the financial system and the broader economy.

In January 2009, the CPSS and the Technical Committee of IOSCO established a working group to provide guidance on the application of these recommendations to CCPs that clear OTC derivatives products and to develop a set of considerations for TRs in designing and operating their systems. The reports of this working group, <i>Guidance on the application of 2004 CPSS-IOSCO recommendations for central counterparties to OTC derivatives CCPs </i>and <i>Considerations for trade repositories in OTC derivatives markets</i>, were issued as consultative reports in May 2010.

Through the centralisation of specific activities, FMIs also allow participants to manage their risks more efficiently and effectively, and, in some instances, eliminate certain risks. FMIs can also promote increased transparency in particular markets. Some FMIs are critical to helping central banks conduct monetary policy and maintain financial stability. </a><a href="#bookmark37" class="s8">6</a></p></li><li data-list-text="1.9."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FMIs can differ significantly in organisation, function, and design. FMIs can be legally organised in a variety of forms, including associations of financial institutions, non- bank clearing corporations, and specialised banking organisations. FMIs may be owned and operated by a central bank or by the private sector. FMIs may also operate as for-profit or not-for-profit entities. Depending on organisational form, FMIs can be subject to different licensing and regulatory schemes within and across jurisdictions. For example, bank and non-bank FMIs are often regulated differently. For the purposes of this report, the definition of an FMI includes five key types of FMIs: payment systems, CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs. There can be significant variation in design among FMIs with the same function. For example, some FMIs use real-time settlement, while others may use deferred settlement. Some FMIs settle individual transactions while others settle batches of transactions. Annex D provides greater detail on different designs for payment systems, SSSs, and CCPs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark36">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">5</span>  The general analytical approach of this report is to consider FMIs as multilateral systems, inclusive of their participants, as stated in the definition of FMI. In market parlance, however, the term FMI may be used to refer only to a legal or functional entity that is set up to carry out centralised, multilateral payment, clearing, settlement, or recording activities and, in some contexts, may exclude the participants that use the system. This difference in terminology or usage may introduce ambiguity at certain points in the report. To address this issue, the report may refer to an FMI <i>and </i>its participants, or to an FMI <i>including </i>its participants, to emphasize the coverage of a principle or other text where this is not clear from the context. The definition of FMIs excludes bilateral relationships between financial institutions and their customers, such as traditional correspondent banking.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a>6<span class="s10">  Typically, the effective implementation of monetary policy depends on the orderly settlement of transactions and the efficient distribution of liquidity. For example, many central banks implement monetary policy by influencing short-term interest rates through the purchase and sale of certain financial instruments, such as government securities or foreign exchange, or through collateralised lending. It is important that FMIs be safe and efficient and allow for the reliable transfer of funds and securities between the central bank, its counterparties, and the other participants in the financial system so that the effect of monetary policy transactions can be spread widely and quickly throughout the economy.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10">&zwnj;</a>Payment systems</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.10."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark38" class="a">A payment system is a set of instruments, procedures, and rules for the transfer of funds between or among participants; the system includes the participants and the entity operating the arrangement. Payment systems are typically based on an agreement between or among participants and the operator of the arrangement, and the transfer of funds is effected using an agreed-upon operational infrastructure. A payment system is generally categorised as either a retail payment system or a large-value payment system (LVPS). A retail payment system is a funds transfer system that typically handles a large volume of relatively low-value payments in such forms as cheques, credit transfers, direct debits, and card payment transactions. Retail payment systems may be operated either by the private sector or the public sector, using a multilateral deferred net settlement (DNS) or a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) mechanism.</a>7<span class="p"> An LVPS is a funds transfer system that typically handles large-value and high-priority payments.

A CSD can hold securities either in physical form (but immobilised) or in dematerialised form (that is, they exist only as electronic records). The precise activities of a CSD vary based on jurisdiction and market practices.

Such systems allow transfers of securities either free of payment or against payment. When transfer is against payment, many systems provide delivery versus payment (DvP), where delivery of the security occurs if and only if payment occurs. An SSS may be organised to provide additional securities clearing and settlement functions, such as the confirmation of trade and settlement instructions. The definition of an SSS in this report is narrower than the one used in the RSSS, which defined an SSS broadly to include the full set of institutional arrangements for confirmation, clearance, and settlement of securities trades and safekeeping of securities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark38">&zwnj;</a>7<span class="s10">  In some countries, these retail payment systems may be systemically important systems.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a>8<span class="s10">  In a direct holding system, each beneficial or direct owner of the security is known to the CSD or the issuer.

For example, CCPs typically require participants to provide collateral (in the form of initial margin and other financial resources) to cover current and potential future exposures. CCPs may also mutualise certain risks through devices such as default funds. As a result of their potential to reduce risks to participants, CCPs also can reduce systemic risk in the markets they serve. The effectiveness of a CCP’s risk controls and the adequacy of its financial resources are critical to achieving these risk- reduction benefits.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14">&zwnj;</a>Trade repositories</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.14."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark44" class="a">A trade repository is an entity that maintains a centralised electronic record (database) of transaction data.</a>13<span class="p"> TRs have emerged as a new type of FMI and have recently grown in importance, particularly in the OTC derivatives market. By centralising the collection, storage, and dissemination of data, a well-designed TR that operates with effective risk controls can serve an important role in enhancing the transparency of transaction information to relevant authorities and the public, promoting financial stability, and supporting the detection and prevention of market abuse. An important function of a TR is to provide information that supports risk reduction, operational efficiency and effectiveness, and cost savings for both individual entities and the market as a whole. Such entities may include the principals to a trade, their agents, CCPs, and other service providers offering complementary services, including central settlement of payment obligations, electronic novation  and  affirmation,  portfolio  compression  and  reconciliation,  and  collateral</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark42">&zwnj;</a>11<span class="s10"> In markets where a CCP does not exist, a guarantee arrangement may provide market participants with some degree of protection against losses from counterparty defaults.

Guarantee arrangements vary greatly from simple insurance-based schemes to more-sophisticated structures comparable to a CCP.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a>12<span class="s10"> Through novation, the original contract between the buyer and seller is extinguished and replaced by two new contracts, one between the CCP and the buyer, and the other between the CCP and the seller.

Timely and reliable access to data stored in a TR has the potential to improve significantly the ability of relevant authorities and the public to identify and evaluate the potential risks posed to the broader financial system (see Principle 24 on disclosure of market data by TRs). Relevant authorities, in particular, should have effective and practical access to data stored in a TR, including participant-level data, which such authorities require to carry out their respective regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A TR may serve a number of stakeholders that depend on having effective access to TR services, both to submit and retrieve data. In addition to relevant authorities and the public, other stakeholders can include exchanges, electronic trading venues, confirmation or matching platforms, and third-party service providers that use TR data to offer complementary services. It is essential, therefore, for a TR to design its access policies and terms of use in a manner that supports fair and open access to its services and data (see Principle 18 on access and participation requirements). Another important benefit of a TR is its promotion of standardisation through the provision of a common technical platform that requires consistency in data formats and representations. The result is a centralised store of transaction data with greater usefulness and reliability than when the data are dispersed.</p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark47" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;">Central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities for TRs have a responsibility to mutually support each other’s access to data in which they have a material interest as part of their regulatory, supervisory, and oversight responsibilities, consistent with the G20 Declaration at the 2010 Toronto Summit.</a>15<span class="s12"> As market infrastructures continue to evolve, TRs may develop for a variety of products and asset classes both within and across particular jurisdictions, and cooperation among authorities will become increasingly important (see Responsibility E on cooperation with other authorities).

The effects of such a disruption could extend well beyond the FMIs and their participants, threatening the stability of domestic and international financial markets and the broader economy. In contrast, robust FMIs have been shown to be an important source of strength in financial markets, giving market participants the confidence to fulfil their obligations on time, even in periods of market stress. In relation to CCPs, the objectives of safety and efficiency are even more pertinent because national authorities have required or proposed the mandatory use of centralised clearing in an increasing number of financial markets.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark16">&zwnj;</a>Achieving the public policy objectives</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.16."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Market forces alone will not necessarily achieve fully the public policy objectives of safety and efficiency because FMIs and their participants do not necessarily bear all the risks and costs associated with their payment, clearing, settlement, and recording activities. Moreover, the institutional structure of an FMI may not provide strong incentives or mechanisms for safe and efficient design and operation, fair and open access, or the protection of participant and customer assets. In addition, participants may not consider the full impact of their actions on other participants, such as the potential costs of delaying payments or settlements. Overall, an FMI and its participants may generate significant negative externalities for the entire financial system and real economy if they do not adequately manage their risks. In addition, factors such as economies of scale, barriers to entry, or even legal mandates, may limit competition and confer market power on an FMI, which could lead to lower levels of service, higher prices, or under-investment in risk- management systems. Caution is needed, however, as excessive competition between FMIs may lead to a competitive lowering of risk standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a>Safety as a public policy objective</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.17."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To ensure their safety and promote financial stability more broadly, FMIs should robustly manage their risks. An FMI should first identify and understand the types of risks that arise in or are transmitted by the FMI and then determine the sources of these risks. Once these risks are properly assessed, appropriate and effective mechanisms should be developed to monitor and manage them. These risks, described in Section 2 of the report, include (but are not limited to) legal, credit, liquidity, general business, custody, investment, and operational risks. The principles for FMIs in this report provide guidance to FMIs and authorities on the identification, monitoring, mitigation, and management of the full range of these risks.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark18">&zwnj;</a>Efficiency as a public policy objective</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.18."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should be not only safe, but also efficient.

FMIs that are determined by national authorities to be systemically important are expected to observe these principles. Where they exist, statutory definitions of systemic importance may vary somewhat across jurisdictions, but in general a payment system is systemically important if it has the potential to trigger or transmit systemic disruptions; this includes, among other things, systems that are the sole payment system in a country or the principal system in terms of the aggregate value of payments; systems that mainly handle time-critical, high-value payments; and systems that settle payments used to effect settlement in other systemically important FMIs.</a>19<span class="p"> The presumption is that all CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs are systemically important, at least in the jurisdiction where they are located, typically because of their critical roles in the markets they serve. If an authority determines that a CSD, SSS, CCP or TR in its jurisdiction is not systemically important and, therefore, not subject to the principles, the authority should disclose the name of the FMI and a clear and comprehensive rationale for the determination. Conversely, an authority may disclose the criteria used to identify which FMIs are considered as systemically important and may disclose which FMIs it regards as systemically important against these criteria. These principles are designed to apply to domestic, cross-border, and multicurrency FMIs.

However, a few principles are only relevant to specific types of FMIs (see Table 1 for general applicability of principles to specific types of FMIs and Annex E for applicability of key considerations to specific types of FMIs). For example, because TRs do not face credit or liquidity risks, the principles on credit and liquidity risks are not applicable to them, while Principle 24 on disclosure of market data by TRs applies only to TRs. In addition, where a principle applies in a specific way to a particular type of FMI, the report tries to provide appropriate direction. For example, Principle 4 on credit risk provides specific guidance to payment systems, SSSs, and CCPs.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.22."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The applicability of the principles and key considerations to specific types of FMIs, as shown in Table 1, is based on the functional definitions of each type of FMI, provided in paragraphs 1.10 to 1.14. In certain cases, however, the same legal entity may perform the functions of more than one type of FMI. For example, many CSDs also operate an SSS, and some payment systems perform certain functions similar to a CCP. In other cases, the definition of a particular type of FMI in a particular jurisdiction may differ from the definition of that type of FMI in this report. In all cases, the set of principles applicable to an FMI are those that address the functions performed by the particular entity.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.23."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In general, the principles are applicable to FMIs operated by central banks, as well as those operated by the private sector. Central banks should apply the same standards to their FMIs as those that are applicable to similar private-sector FMIs. However, there are exceptional cases where the principles are applied differently to FMIs operated by central banks due to requirements in relevant law, regulation, or policy. For example, central banks may have separate public policy objectives and responsibilities for monetary and liquidity policies that take precedence.

Given the systemic importance of the FMIs to which the principles in this report are addressed, the disorderly failure of an FMI would likely lead to systemic disruptions to the institutions and markets supported by the FMI, to any other FMIs to which the failing FMI is linked, and to the financial system more broadly. The negative implications would be particularly severe in situations in which no other FMI could promptly and effectively provide a substitute for the critical operations and services of the failing FMI.</p></li><li data-list-text="1.25."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark53" class="a">In the event that an FMI becomes non-viable as a going concern or insolvent, it is important that appropriate actions be taken that allow (a) the recovery of the FMI so that its critical operations and services may be sustained, or (b) the winding down of the non-viable FMI in an orderly manner, for instance by transferring the FMI’s critical operations and services to an alternate entity. Depending on the specific situation and the powers and tools available to authorities in relevant jurisdictions, these actions may be implemented by the FMI itself, by the relevant authorities, or by a combination of both. The principles in this report identify a number of measures that FMIs should take to prepare for and facilitate the implementation of their own recovery or orderly wind-down plans, if needed. Issues and analysis related to the potential necessity, design, and implementation of additional official resolution regimes for FMIs, including the resolution powers and tools that may be useful for relevant authorities in such regimes, will be the focus of separate CPSS-IOSCO work, which will build, as far as possible, on the previous work by the FSB on effective resolution regimes for financial institutions.</a><a href="#bookmark53" class="s8">20</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark23">&zwnj;</a>Access to FMIs</h2></li><li data-list-text="1.26."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark54" class="a">Access to an FMI is typically important because of the critical role many FMIs play in the markets they serve.

Tiered participation arrangements may allow wider access to the services of an FMI. The dependencies and risk exposures (including credit, liquidity, and operational risks) inherent in these tiered arrangements can, however, present risks to the FMI and its smooth functioning, as well as to the participants themselves and the broader financial markets. These risks may be particularly acute for systems with a high degree of tiering.

For each standard, there is a list of key considerations that further explain the headline standard. An accompanying explanatory note discusses the objective and rationale of the standard and provides guidance on how the standard can be implemented.

Through the centralisation of certain activities, FMIs allow participants to manage their risks more effectively and efficiently, and, in some instances, reduce or eliminate certain risks. By performing centralised activities, however, FMIs concentrate risks and create interdependencies between and among FMIs and participating institutions. In addition to discussing systemic risk, this section of the report provides an overview of specific key risks faced by FMIs. These include legal, credit, liquidity, general business, custody, investment, and operational risks. Whether an FMI, its participants, or both face a particular form of risk, as well as the degree of risk, will depend on the type of FMI and its design.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark60">&zwnj;</a>Systemic risk<a name="bookmark68">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Safe and efficient FMIs mitigate systemic risk. FMIs may themselves face systemic risk, however, because the inability of one or more participants to perform as expected could cause other participants to be unable to meet their obligations when due. In such circumstances, a variety of “knock-on” effects are possible, and an FMI’s inability to complete settlement could have significant adverse effects on the markets it serves and the broader economy. These adverse effects, for example, could arise from unwinding or reversing payments or deliveries; delaying the settlement or close out of guaranteed transactions; or immediately liquidating collateral, margin, or other assets at fire sale prices. If an FMI were to take such steps, its participants could suddenly be faced with significant and unexpected credit and liquidity exposures that might be extremely difficult to manage at the time. This, in turn, might lead to further disruptions in the financial system and undermine public confidence in the safety, soundness, and reliability of the financial infrastructure.</p></li><li data-list-text="2.3."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark70" class="a">More broadly, FMIs may be linked to or dependent upon one another, may have common participants, and may serve interconnected institutions and markets. Complex interdependencies may be a normal part of an FMI’s structure or operations. In many cases, interdependencies have facilitated significant improvements in the safety and efficiency of FMIs’ activities and processes. Interdependencies, however, can also present an important source of systemic risk.</a>23<span class="p"> For example, these interdependencies raise the potential for disruptions to spread quickly and widely across markets. If an FMI depends on the smooth functioning of one or more FMIs for its payment, clearing, settlement, and recording processes, a disruption in one FMI can disrupt other FMIs simultaneously. These interdependencies, consequently, can transmit disruptions beyond a specific FMI and its participants and affect the broader economy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark61">&zwnj;</a>Legal risk<a name="bookmark69">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the purposes of this report, legal risk is the risk of the unexpected application of a law or regulation, usually resulting in a loss. Legal risk can also arise if the application of relevant laws and regulations is uncertain. For example, legal risk encompasses the risk that a counterparty faces from an unexpected application of a law that renders contracts illegal or unenforceable. Legal risk also includes the risk of loss resulting from a delay in the recovery of financial assets or a freezing of positions resulting from a legal procedure. In cross-border as well as some national contexts, different bodies of law can apply to a single transaction,</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark70">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">23</span> See also CPSS, <i>The interdependencies of payment and settlement systems</i>, June 2008.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">activity, or participant. In such instances, an FMI and its participants may face losses resulting from the unexpected application of a law, or the application of a law different from that specified in a contract, by a court in a relevant jurisdiction.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark62">&zwnj;</a>Credit risk<a name="bookmark71">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.5."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FMIs and their participants may face various types of credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty, whether a participant or other entity, will be unable to meet fully its financial obligations when due, or at any time in the future. FMIs and their participants may face replacement-cost risk (often associated with pre-settlement risk) and principal risk (often associated with settlement risk). Replacement-cost risk is the risk of loss of unrealised gains on unsettled transactions with a counterparty (for example, the unsettled transactions of a CCP). The resulting exposure is the cost of replacing the original transaction at current market prices. Principal risk is the risk that a counterparty will lose the full value involved in a transaction, for example, the risk that a seller of a financial asset will irrevocably deliver the asset but not receive payment. Credit risk can also arise from other sources, such as the failure of settlement banks, custodians, or linked FMIs to meet their financial obligations.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a>Liquidity risk<a name="bookmark72">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.6."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FMIs and their participants may face liquidity risk, which is the risk that a counterparty, whether a participant or other entity, will have insufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as and when expected, although it may be able to do so in the future. Liquidity risk includes the risk that a seller of an asset will not receive payment when due, and the seller may have to borrow or liquidate assets to complete other payments. It also includes the risk that a buyer of an asset will not receive delivery when due, and the buyer may have to borrow the asset in order to complete its own delivery obligation. Thus, both parties to a financial transaction are potentially exposed to liquidity risk on the settlement date. Liquidity problems have the potential to create systemic problems, particularly if they occur when markets are closed or illiquid or when asset prices are changing rapidly, or if they create concerns about solvency. Liquidity risk can also arise from other sources, such as the failure or the inability of settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and linked FMIs to perform as expected.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark64">&zwnj;</a>General business risk<a name="bookmark73">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.7."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, FMIs face general business risks, which are the risks related to the administration and operation of an FMI as a business enterprise, excluding those related to the default of a participant or another entity, such as a settlement bank, global custodian, or another FMI. General business risk refers to any potential impairment of the financial condition (as a business concern) of an FMI due to declines in its revenues or growth in its expenses, resulting in expenses exceeding revenues and a loss that must be charged against capital. Such impairment may be a result of adverse reputational effects, poor execution of business strategy, ineffective response to competition, losses in other business lines of the FMI or its parent, or other business factors. Business-related losses also may arise from risks covered by other principles, for example, legal or operational risk. A failure to manage general business risk could result in a disruption of an FMI’s business operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a>Custody and investment risks<a name="bookmark74">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.8."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FMIs may also face custody and investment risks on the assets that they own and those they hold on behalf of their participants. Custody risk is the risk of loss on assets held in custody in the event of a custodian’s (or sub-custodian’s) insolvency, negligence, fraud,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">poor administration, or inadequate recordkeeping. Investment risk is the risk of loss faced by an FMI when it invests its own or its participants’ resources, such as collateral. These risks can be relevant not only to the costs of holding and investing resources but also to the safety and reliability of an FMI’s risk-management systems. The failure of an FMI to properly safeguard its assets could result in credit, liquidity, and reputational problems for the FMI itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark66">&zwnj;</a>Operational risk<a name="bookmark75">&zwnj;</a></p></li><li data-list-text="2.9."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All FMIs face operational risk, which is the risk that deficiencies in information systems or internal processes, human errors, management failures, or disruptions from external events will result in the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services provided by an FMI. These operational failures may lead to consequent delays, losses, liquidity problems, and in some cases systemic risks. Operational deficiencies also can reduce the effectiveness of measures that FMIs may take to manage risk, for example, by impairing their ability to complete settlement, or by hampering their ability to monitor and manage their credit exposures. In the case of TRs, operational deficiencies could limit the usefulness of the transaction data maintained by a TR. Possible operational failures include errors or delays in processing, system outages, insufficient capacity, fraud, and data loss and leakage. Operational risk can stem from both internal and external sources. For example, participants can generate operational risk for FMIs and other participants, which could result in liquidity or operational problems within the broader financial system.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="border:0.5pt solid #000000;display:block;min-height:185.6pt;width:453.6pt;"><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Box 2</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Risk considerations for trade repositories</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TRs face risks that, if not controlled effectively, could have a material negative impact on the markets they serve. The primary risk to a TR is operational risk, although other risks may hamper its safe and efficient functioning. As part of its core recordkeeping function, a TR must ensure that the data it maintains is accurate and current in order to serve as a reliable central data source. The continuous availability of data stored in a TR is also essential. Specific operational risks that a TR must manage include risks to data integrity, data security, and business continuity. Because the data recorded by a TR may be used as inputs to the activities of the TR’s participants, relevant authorities, and other parties, including other FMIs and service providers, all trade data collected, stored, and disseminated by a TR should be protected from corruption, loss, leakage, unauthorised access, and other processing risks. In addition, a TR may be part of a network linking various entities (such as CCPs, dealers, custodians, and service providers) and could transmit risk or cause processing delays to such linked entities in the event of an operational disruption.</p></div></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h1 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark76">&zwnj;</a>3.0.

The legal basis defines, or provides the foundation for relevant parties to define, the rights and obligations of the FMI, its participants, and other relevant parties, such as its participants’ customers, custodians, settlement banks, and service providers. Most risk-management mechanisms are based on assumptions about the manner and time at which these rights and obligations arise through the FMI. Therefore, if risk management is to be sound and effective, the enforceability of rights and obligations relating to an FMI and its risk management should be established with a high degree of certainty. If the legal basis for an FMI’s activities and operations is inadequate, uncertain, or opaque, then the FMI, its participants, and their customers may face unintended, uncertain, or unmanageable credit or liquidity risks, which may also create or amplify systemic risks.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark81">&zwnj;</a>Legal basis</p></li><li data-list-text="3.1.2."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark297" class="a">The legal basis should provide a high degree of certainty for each material aspect of an FMI’s activities in all relevant jurisdictions.</a>24<span class="p"> The legal basis consists of the legal framework and the FMI’s rules, procedures, and contracts. The legal framework includes general laws and regulations that govern, among other things, property, contracts, insolvency, corporations, securities, banking, secured interests, and liability. In some cases, the legal framework that governs competition and consumer and investor protection may also be relevant. Laws and regulations specific to an FMI’s activities include those governing its authorization and its regulation, supervision, and oversight; rights and interests in financial instruments; settlement finality; netting; immobilisation and dematerialisation of securities; arrangements  for  DvP,  PvP,  or  DvD;  collateral  arrangements  (including  margin arrangements); default procedures; and the resolution of an FMI. An FMI should establish rules, procedures, and contracts that are clear, understandable, and consistent with the legal framework and provide a high degree of legal certainty. An FMI also should consider whether the rights and obligations of the FMI, its participants, and as appropriate, other parties, as set forth in its rules, procedures, and contracts are consistent with relevant industry standards and market protocols.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3.1.3."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should be able to articulate the legal basis for its activities to relevant authorities, participants, and, where relevant, participants’ customers in a clear and understandable way. One recommended approach to articulating the legal basis for each material aspect of an FMI’s activities is to obtain well-reasoned and independent legal opinions or analyses. A legal opinion or analysis should, to the extent practicable, confirm the enforceability of the FMI’s rules and procedures and must provide reasoned support for its conclusions. An FMI should consider sharing these legal opinions and analyses with its participants in an effort to promote confidence among participants and transparency in the system. In addition, an FMI should seek to ensure that its activities are consistent with the legal basis in all relevant jurisdictions. These jurisdictions could include (a) those where an FMI is conducting business (including through linked FMIs); (b) those where its participants are incorporated, located, or otherwise conducting business for the purposes of participation;</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">(c) those where collateral is located or held; and (d) those indicated in relevant contracts.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.1.4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A TR’s rules, procedures, and contracts should be clear about the legal status of the transaction records that it stores. Most TRs store transaction data that do not represent legally enforceable trade records. For some TRs, however, participants may agree that the TR’s electronic transaction record provides the official economic details of a legally binding contract, which enables trade details to be used for the calculation of payment obligations and other events that may occur during the life of the transaction. A TR should identify and mitigate any legal risks associated with any such ancillary services that it may provide. Further, the legal basis should also determine the rules and procedures for providing access and disclosing data to participants, relevant authorities, and the public to meet their respective information needs, as well as data protection and confidentiality issues (see also Principle 24 on disclosure of market data by TRs).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark297">&zwnj;</a>24<span class="s10"> The materiality of an aspect of an FMI´s activity has to be determined in light of this report’s objectives – enhancing safety and efficiency – and underlying principles.

In addition, parts of the activity that have a significant effect on the FMI’s efficiency may also qualify as material aspects of the activity covered by the principle on legal basis.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark82">&zwnj;</a>Rights and interests</p></li><li data-list-text="3.1.5."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark298" class="a">The legal basis should clearly define the rights and interests of an FMI, its participants, and, where relevant, its participants’ customers in the financial instruments, such as cash and securities, or other relevant assets held in custody, directly or indirectly, by the FMI. The legal basis should fully protect both a participant’s assets held in custody by the FMI and, where appropriate, a participant’s customer’s assets held by or through the FMI from the insolvency of relevant parties and other relevant risks. It should also protect these assets when held at a custodian or linked FMI. In particular, consistent with Principle 11 on CSDs and Principle 14 on segregation and portability, the legal basis should protect the assets and positions of a participant’s customers in a CSD and CCP. In addition, the legal basis should provide certainty, where applicable, with respect to an FMI’s interests in, and rights to use and dispose of, collateral; an FMI’s authority to transfer ownership rights or property interests; and an FMI’s rights to make and receive payments, in all cases, notwithstanding the bankruptcy or insolvency of its participants, participants’ customers, or custodian bank.</a>25<span class="p"> Also, the FMI should structure its operations so that its claims against collateral provided to it by a participant should have priority over all other claims, and the claims of the participant to that same collateral should have priority over the claims of third- party creditors.

Settlement finality is an important building block for risk-management systems (see also Principle 8). An FMI should consider, in particular, the actions that would need to be taken in the event of a participant’s insolvency. A key question is whether transactions of an insolvent participant would be honoured as final, or could be considered void or voidable by liquidators and relevant authorities.

An FMI should also have a high degree of certainty that the transfer itself is not voidable as an unlawful preference under insolvency law.

In such cases, an FMI should identify and analyse potential conflict-of-laws issues and develop rules and procedures to mitigate this risk. For example, the rules governing its activities should clearly indicate the law that is intended to apply to each aspect of an FMI’s operations. The FMI and its participants should be aware of applicable constraints on their abilities to choose the law that will govern the FMI’s activities when there is a difference in the substantive laws of the relevant jurisdictions. For example, such constraints may exist because of jurisdictions’ differing laws on insolvency and irrevocability. A jurisdiction ordinarily does not permit contractual choices of law that would circumvent that jurisdiction’s fundamental public policy. Thus, when uncertainty exists regarding the enforceability of an FMI’s choice of law in relevant jurisdictions, the FMI should obtain reasoned and independent legal opinions and analysis in order to address properly such uncertainty.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark87">&zwnj;</a>Mitigating legal risk</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3.1.12.  In general, there is no substitute for a sound legal basis and full legal certainty. In some practical situations, however, full legal certainty may not be achievable. In this case, the authorities may need to take steps to address the legal framework. Pending this resolution, an FMI should investigate steps to mitigate its legal risk through the selective use of alternative risk-management tools that do not suffer from the legal uncertainty identified. These could include, in appropriate circumstances and if legally enforceable, participant requirements, exposure limits, collateral requirements, and prefunded default arrangements. The use of such tools may limit an FMI’s exposure if its activities are found to be not supported by relevant laws and regulations. If such controls are insufficient or not feasible, an FMI could apply activity limits and, in extreme circumstances, restrict access or not perform the problematic activity until the legal situation is addressed.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark88">&zwnj;</a>Principle 2: Governance<a name="bookmark304">&zwnj;</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety and efficiency of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant public interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark89">&zwnj;</a>Key considerations</h2><ol id="l14"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have objectives that place a high priority on the safety and efficiency of the FMI and explicitly support financial stability and other relevant public interest considerations.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have documented governance arrangements that provide clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability.

Supporting the public interest is a broad concept that includes, for example, fostering fair and efficient markets. For example, in certain OTC derivatives markets, industry standards and market protocols have been developed to increase certainty, transparency, and stability in the market. If a CCP in such markets were to diverge from these practices, it could, in some cases, undermine the market’s efforts to develop common processes to help reduce uncertainty. An FMI’s governance arrangements should also include appropriate consideration of the interests of participants, participants’ customers, relevant authorities, and other stakeholders. A TR, for example, should have objectives, policies, and procedures that support the effective and appropriate disclosure of market data to relevant authorities and the public (see Principle 24). For all types of FMIs, governance arrangements should provide for fair and open access (see Principle 18 on access and participation requirements) and for effective implementation of recovery or wind-down plans, or resolution.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark92">&zwnj;</a>Governance arrangements</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.3."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Governance arrangements, which define the structure under which the board and management operate, should be clearly and thoroughly documented.

Arrangements may differ significantly because of national law, ownership structure, or organisational form. For example, national law may require an FMI to maintain a two-tier board system in which the supervisory board (all non-executive directors) is separated from the management board (all executive directors). Further, an FMI may be owned by its participants or by another organisation, may be operated as a for-profit or not- for-profit enterprise, or may be organised as a bank or non-bank entity. While specific arrangements vary, this principle is intended to be generally applicable to all ownership and organisational structures.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.5."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark305" class="a">Depending on its ownership structure and organisational form, an FMI may need to focus particular attention on certain aspects of its governance arrangements. An FMI that is part of a larger organisation, for example, should place particular emphasis on the clarity of its governance arrangements, including in relation to any conflicts of interests and outsourcing issues that may arise because of the parent or other affiliated organisation’s structure. The FMI’s governance arrangements should also be adequate to ensure that decisions of affiliated organisations are not detrimental to the FMI.</a>31<span class="p"> An FMI that is, or is part</span></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark305">&zwnj;</a>31<span class="s10"> If an FMI is wholly owned or controlled by another entity, authorities should also review the governance arrangements of that entity to see that they do not have adverse effects on the FMI’s observance of this principle.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of, a for-profit entity may need to place particular emphasis on managing any conflicts between income generation and safety.

If an FMI provides services that present a distinct risk profile from, and potentially pose significant additional risks to, its payment, clearing, settlement, or recording function, the FMI needs to manage those additional risks adequately. This may include separating the additional services that the FMI provides from its payment, clearing, settlement, and recording function legally, or taking equivalent action. The ownership structure and organisational form may also need to be considered in the preparation and implementation of the FMI’s recovery or wind-down plans or in assessments of the FMI’s resolvability.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.7."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Central bank-operated systems may need to tailor the application of this principle in light of the central bank’s own governance requirements and specific policy mandates. If a central bank is an operator of an FMI, as well as the overseer of private-sector FMIs, it needs to consider how to best address any possible or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise between those functions. Except when explicitly required by law, regulation, or policy mandates, a central bank should avoid using its oversight authority to disadvantage private- sector FMIs relative to an FMI the central bank owns or operates. This can be facilitated by separating the operator and oversight functions into different organisational units within the central bank that are managed by different personnel. Where there is competition with private-sector systems, a central bank should also be careful to protect confidential information about external systems collected in its role as overseer and avoid its misuse.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark93">&zwnj;</a>Roles, responsibilities, and composition of the board of directors</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.8."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark306" class="a">An FMI’s board has multiple roles and responsibilities that should be clearly specified.

Additionally, senior management should be actively involved in the risk-control process and should ensure that significant resources are devoted to its risk-management framework.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark95">&zwnj;</a>Risk-management governance</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.12."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because the board is ultimately responsible for managing an FMI’s risks, it should establish a clear, documented risk-management framework that includes the FMI’s risk-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark308">&zwnj;</a>34<span class="s10"> Having non-executive members included on a board, for example, may (depending on local corporate law) help in balancing considerations of safety and efficiency with competitiveness and, where applicable, profitability.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark309">&zwnj;</a>35<span class="s10"> An FMI organised in a jurisdiction with national laws on board structure or composition that do not facilitate the use of independent members should use alternative means to enhance its board’s ability to exercise independent judgment, such as advisory or supervisory boards with appropriate members.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tolerance policy, assigns responsibilities and accountability for risk decisions, and addresses decision making in crises and emergencies. The board should regularly monitor the FMI’s risk profile to ensure that it is consistent with the FMI’s business strategy and risk-tolerance policy. In addition, the board should ensure that the FMI has an effective system of controls and oversight, including adequate governance and project management processes, over the models used to quantify, aggregate, and manage the FMI’s risks. Board approval should be required for material decisions that would have a significant impact on the risk profile of the entity, such as the limits for total credit exposure and large individual credit exposures. Other material decisions that may require board approval include the introduction of new products, implementation of new links, use of new crisis-management frameworks, adoption of processes and templates for reporting significant risk exposures, and adoption of processes for considering adherence to relevant market protocols. In the OTC derivatives markets, CCPs are expected to adhere to practices or arrangements that have become established market conventions or to act in a manner that does not conflict with such terms, unless the CCP has reasonable grounds not to do so and that does not conflict with the market’s wider interest. In this regard, where a CCP supports a market and is expected to fully adhere to marketwide protocols and related decisions, the CCP should be involved in the development and establishment of such standards. It is critical that market governance processes fully reflect the role of the CCP in the market. The arrangements adopted by a CCP should be transparent to its participants and regulators.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.13."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The board and governance arrangements, generally, should support the use of clear and comprehensive rules and key procedures, including detailed and effective participant- default rules and procedures (see Principle 13). The board should have procedures in place to support its capacity to act appropriately and immediately if any risks arise that threaten the FMI’s viability as a going concern. The governance arrangements should also provide for effective decision making in a crisis and support any procedures and rules designed to facilitate the recovery or orderly wind-down of the FMI.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.14."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, the governance of the risk-management function is particularly important.  It  is  essential  that  an  FMI’s  risk-management  personnel  have  sufficient independence, authority, resources, and access to the board to ensure that the operations of the FMI are consistent with the risk-management framework set by the board. The reporting lines for risk management should be clear and separate from those for other operations of the FMI, and there should be an additional direct reporting line to a non-executive director on the board via a chief risk officer (or equivalent). To help the board discharge its risk-related responsibilities, an FMI should consider the case for a risk committee, responsible for advising the board on the FMI’s overall current and future risk tolerance and strategy. A CCP, however, should have such a risk committee or its equivalent. An FMI’s risk committee should be chaired by a sufficiently knowledgeable individual who is independent of the FMI’s executive management and be composed of a majority of members who are non-executive members. The committee should have a clear and public mandate and operating procedures and, where appropriate, have access to external expert advice.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.15."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Where an FMI, in accordance with applicable law, maintains a two-tier board system, the roles and responsibilities of the board and senior management will be allocated to the supervisory board and the management board, as appropriate. The reporting lines of the risk and other committees need to reflect this allocation, as well as the legal responsibilities of the management and supervisory boards. Therefore a direct reporting line for the risk-management function may involve members of the management board. In addition, the establishment of a risk committee has to take into account the legally founded responsibility of the management board for managing the risks of the FMI.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark96">&zwnj;</a>Model validation</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.16."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The board should ensure that there is adequate governance surrounding the adoption and use of models, such as for credit, collateral, margining, and liquidity</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">risk-management systems. An FMI should validate, on an ongoing basis, the models and their methodologies used to quantify, aggregate, and manage the FMI’s risks. The validation process should be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the models and their methodologies, and the validation process should be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. Validation should include (a) an evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the models, (b) an ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking, and (c) an analysis of outcomes that includes backtesting.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark97">&zwnj;</a>Internal controls and audit</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.17."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The board is responsible for establishing and overseeing internal controls and audit.

For example, as part of a variety of risk controls, the board should ensure that there are adequate internal controls to protect against the misuse of confidential information. An FMI should also have an effective internal audit function, with sufficient resources and independence from management to provide, among other activities, a rigorous and independent assessment of the effectiveness of an FMI’s risk-management and control processes (see also Principle 3 on the framework for the comprehensive management of risks). The board will typically establish an audit committee to oversee the internal audit function. In addition to reporting to senior management, the audit function should have regular access to the board through an additional reporting line.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark98">&zwnj;</a>Stakeholder input</p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.18."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI’s board should consider all relevant stakeholders’ interests, including those of its direct and indirect participants, in making major decisions, including those relating to the system’s design, rules, and overall business strategy.

Mechanisms for involving stakeholders in the board’s decision-making process may include stakeholder representation on the board (including direct and indirect participants), user committees, and public consultation processes. As opinions among interested parties are likely to differ, the FMI should have clear processes for identifying and appropriately managing the diversity of stakeholder views and any conflicts of interest between stakeholders and the FMI. Without prejudice to local requirements on confidentiality and disclosure, the FMI should clearly and promptly inform its owners, participants, other users, and, where appropriate, the broader public, of the outcome of major decisions, and consider providing summary explanations for decisions to enhance transparency where it would not endanger candid board debate or commercial confidentiality.</p></li></ol></ol></ol><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark99">&zwnj;</a>Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks<a name="bookmark310">&zwnj;</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have a sound risk-management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit, liquidity, operational, and other risks.</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark100">&zwnj;</a>Key considerations</h2><ol id="l18"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have risk-management policies, procedures, and systems that enable it to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI.

An FMI should consider how various risks relate to, and interact with, each other. The FMI should have a sound risk-management framework (including policies, procedures, and systems) that enable it to identify, measure, monitor, and manage effectively the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI. An FMI’s framework should include the identification and management of interdependencies. An FMI should also provide appropriate incentives and the relevant information for its participants and other entities to manage and contain their risks vis-à-vis the FMI. As discussed in Principle 2 on governance, the board of directors plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining a sound risk-management framework.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark102">&zwnj;</a>Identification of risks</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To establish a sound risk-management framework, an FMI should first identify the range of risks that arise within the FMI and the risks it directly bears from or poses to its participants, its participants’ customers, and other entities. It should identify those risks that could materially affect its ability to perform or to provide services as expected. Typically these include legal, credit, liquidity, and operational risks. An FMI should also consider other relevant and material risks, such as market (or price), concentration, and general business risks, as well as risks that do not appear to be significant in isolation, but when combined with other risks become material. The consequences of these risks may have significant reputational effects on the FMI and may undermine an FMI’s financial soundness as well as the stability of the broader financial markets. In identifying risks, an FMI should take a broad perspective and identify the risks that it bears from other entities, such as other FMIs, settlement banks, liquidity providers, service providers, and any entities that could be materially affected by the FMI’s inability to provide services. For example, the relationship</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">between an SSS and an LVPS to achieve DvP settlement can create system-based interdependencies.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark103">&zwnj;</a>Comprehensive risk policies, procedures, and controls</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI’s board and senior management are ultimately responsible for managing the FMI’s risks (see Principle 2 on governance). The board should determine an appropriate level of aggregate risk tolerance and capacity for the FMI. The board and senior management should establish policies, procedures, and controls that are consistent with the FMI’s risk tolerance and capacity. The FMI’s policies, procedures, and controls serve as the basis for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing the FMI’s risks and should cover routine and non-routine events, including the potential inability of a participant, or the FMI itself, to meet its obligations. An FMI’s policies, procedures, and controls should address all relevant risks, including legal, credit, liquidity, general business, and operational risks. These policies, procedures, and controls should be part of a coherent and consistent framework that is reviewed and updated periodically and shared with the relevant authorities.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark104">&zwnj;</a>Information and control systems</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.4."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark311" class="a">In addition, an FMI should employ robust information and risk-control systems to provide the FMI with the capacity to obtain timely information necessary to apply risk- management policies and procedures.

There are several ways in which an FMI may provide incentives. For example, an FMI could apply financial penalties to participants that fail to settle securities in a timely manner or to repay intraday credit by the end of the operating day. Another example is the use of loss-sharing arrangements proportionate to the exposures brought to the FMI. Such approaches can help reduce the moral hazard that may arise from formulas in which losses are shared equally among participants or other formulas where losses are not shared proportionally to risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark311">&zwnj;</a>36<span class="s10"> These information systems should permit, where practicable, the provision of real time information to enable participants to manage risks.

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet fully its financial obligations when due or at any time in the future. These counterparties may include the FMI’s participants (see Principle 4 on credit risk), settlement banks (see Principle 9 on money settlements), and custodians (see Principle 16 on custody and investment risks). Liquidity risk is the risk that a counterparty will have insufficient funds to meet its financial obligations when due, but may be able to do so at some time in the future. Although credit and liquidity risks are distinct concepts, there is often significant interaction between these risks. For example, a participant default in an FMI would likely result in the FMI facing both credit and liquidity risk, potentially requiring the FMI to draw on its liquidity resources to meet its immediate obligations. An FMI has a range of risk-management tools to mitigate and manage these risks.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following set of principles on (a) credit risk management, (b) collateral, (c) margin, and</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(d) liquidity risk management form the core of the standards for financial risk management and financial resources. These principles contain extensive cross references because of the interaction among the four standards. For example, the margin principle builds on the credit risk principle as applied to CCPs. The margin principle is also related to the collateral principle, which establishes the form and attributes of collateral that a CCP should hold. Taken together, these four principles are designed to provide a high degree of confidence that an FMI will continue operating and serve as a source of financial stability even in extreme market conditions. These principles are not applicable to CSDs or TRs to the extent that they do not face credit and liquidity risks.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark110">&zwnj;</a>Principle 4: Credit risk<a name="bookmark315">&zwnj;</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes.

A CCP should collect margin, which is a deposit of collateral in the form of money, securities, or other financial instruments to assure performance and to mitigate its credit exposures for all products that it clears if a participant defaults (see also Principle 5 on collateral). Margin systems typically differentiate between initial margin and variation margin.</a>70<span class="p"> Initial margin is typically collected to cover potential changes in the value of each participant’s position (that is, potential future exposure) over the appropriate close-out period in the event the participant defaults. Calculating potential future exposure requires modelling potential price movements and other relevant factors, as well as specifying the target degree of confidence and length of the close-out period. Variation margin is collected and paid out to reflect current exposures resulting from actual changes in market prices. To calculate variation margin, open positions are marked to current market prices and funds are typically collected from (or paid to) a counterparty to settle any losses (or gains) on those positions.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark131">&zwnj;</a>Margin requirements</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark350" class="a">One of the most common risk-management tools used by CCPs to limit their credit exposure is a requirement that each participant provide collateral to protect the CCP against a high percentile of the distribution of future exposure. In this report, such requirements are described as margin requirements. Margining, however, is not the only risk-management tool available to a CCP (see also Principle 4 on credit risk). In the case of some CCPs for cash markets, the CCP may require each participant to provide collateral to cover credit exposures; they may call these requirements margin, or they may hold this collateral in a pool known as a clearing fund.</a><a href="#bookmark350" class="s8">71</a></p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.3."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark351" class="a">When setting margin requirements, a CCP should have a margin system that establishes margin levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each product, portfolio, and market it serves. Product risk characteristics can include, but are not limited to, price volatility and correlation, non-linear price characteristics, jump-to-default risk, market liquidity, possible liquidation procedures (for example, tender by or commission to market-makers), and correlation between price and position such as wrong-way risk.</a>72<span class="p"> Margin requirements need to account for the complexity of the underlying instruments and the availability of timely, high-quality pricing data. For example, OTC derivatives require more-conservative margin models because of their complexity and the greater uncertainty of the reliability of price quotes. Furthermore, the appropriate close-out period may vary among products and markets depending upon the product’s liquidity, price, and other characteristics. Additionally, a CCP for cash markets (or physically deliverable derivatives products) should take into account the risk of “fails to deliver” of securities (or other relevant instruments) in its margin methodology. In a fails-to-deliver scenario, the CCP should continue to margin positions for which a participant fails to deliver the required security (or other relevant instrument) on the settlement date.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark132">&zwnj;</a>Price information</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP should have a reliable source of timely price data because such data is critical for a CCP’s margin system to operate accurately and effectively.

In certain instances, a CCP may need to determine margin levels using a shorter historical period to reflect new or current volatility in the market more effectively.

Specific wrong-way risk arises where an exposure to a counterparty is highly likely to increase when the creditworthiness of that counterparty is deteriorating. For example, participants in a CCP clearing credit-default swaps should not be allowed to clear single-name credit-default swaps on their own names or on the names of their legal affiliates.

In this context, procyclicality typically refers to changes in risk- management practices that are positively correlated with market, business, or credit cycle fluctuations and that may cause or exacerbate financial instability. For example, in a period of rising price volatility or credit risk of participants, a CCP may require additional initial margin for a given portfolio beyond the amount required by the current margin model. This could exacerbate market stress and volatility further, resulting in additional margin requirements. These adverse effects may occur without any arbitrary change in risk- management practices. To the extent practicable and prudent, a CCP should adopt forward- looking and relatively stable and conservative margin requirements that are specifically designed to limit the need for destabilising, procyclical changes. To support this objective, a CCP could consider increasing the size of its prefunded default arrangements to limit the need and likelihood of large or unexpected margin calls in times of market stress.</a><span class="s15">77</span><span class="p"> These</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark356">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">77</span> See also CGFS, <i>The role of margin requirements and haircuts in procyclicality</i>, March 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">procedures may create additional costs for CCPs and their participants in periods of low market volatility due to higher margin or prefunded default arrangement contributions, but they may also result in additional protection and potentially less costly and less disruptive adjustments in periods of high market volatility. In addition, transparency regarding margin practices when market volatility increases may help mitigate the effects of procyclicality. Nevertheless, it may be impractical and even imprudent for a CCP to establish margin requirements that are independent of significant or cyclical changes in price volatility.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark134">&zwnj;</a>Variation margin</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.11."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP faces the risk that its exposure to its participants can change rapidly as a result of changes in prices, positions, or both. Adverse price movements, as well as participants building larger positions through new trading, can rapidly increase a CCP’s exposures to its participants (although some markets may impose trading limits or position limits that reduce this risk). A CCP can ascertain its current exposure to each participant by marking each participant’s outstanding positions to current market prices. To the extent permitted by a CCP’s rules and supported by law, the CCP should net any gains against any losses and require frequent (at least daily) settlement of gains and losses. This settlement should involve the daily (and, when appropriate, intraday) collection of variation margin from participants whose positions have lost value and can include payments to participants whose positions have gained value. The regular collection of variation margin prevents current exposures from accumulating and mitigates the potential future exposures a CCP might face. A CCP should also have the authority and operational capacity to make intraday variation margin calls and payments, both scheduled and unscheduled, to its participants. A CCP should consider the potential impact of its intraday variation margin collections and payments on the liquidity position of its participants and should have the operational capacity to make intraday variation margin payments.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark135">&zwnj;</a>Portfolio margining</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.12."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark357" class="a">In calculating margin requirements, a CCP may allow offsets or reductions in required margin amounts between products for which it is the counterparty if the risk of one product is significantly and reliably correlated with the risk of another product.</a>78<span class="p"> A CCP should base such offsets on an economically meaningful methodology that reflects the degree of price dependence between the products. Often, price dependence is modelled through correlations, but more complete or robust measures of dependence should be considered, particularly for non-linear products. In any case, the CCP should consider how price dependence can vary with overall market conditions, including in stressed market conditions. Following the application of offsets, the CCP needs to ensure that the margin meets or exceeds the single-tailed confidence level of at least 99 percent with respect to the estimated distribution of the future exposure of the portfolio. If a CCP uses portfolio margining, it should continuously review and test offsets among products. It should test the robustness of its portfolio method on both actual and appropriate hypothetical portfolios. It is especially important to test how correlations perform during periods of actual and simulated market stress to assess whether the correlations break down or otherwise behave erratically.

This harmonisation is especially relevant in terms of selecting an initial margin methodology, setting margin parameters, segregating accounts and collateral, and establishing default-management arrangements. All of the precautions with regard to portfolio margining discussed above would apply to cross- margining  regimes  between  or  among  CCPs.

Backtesting is an ex-post comparison of observed outcomes with the outputs of the margin models. A CCP should also conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the coverage of the margin methodology under various market conditions using historical data from realised stressed market conditions and hypothetical data for unrealised stressed market conditions. Sensitivity analysis should also be used to determine the impact of varying important model parameters. Sensitivity analysis is an effective tool to explore hidden shortcomings that cannot be discovered through backtesting. The results of both the backtesting and sensitivity analyses should be disclosed to participants.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.6.16."><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Backtesting. <a href="#bookmark358" class="a">A CCP should backtest its margin coverage using participant positions from each day in order to evaluate whether there are any exceptions to its initial margin coverage.

The FMI should ensure that the range of parameters and assumptions captures a variety of historical and hypothetical conditions, including the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations between prices. The CCP should conduct sensitivity analysis on its margin model coverage at least monthly using the results of these sensitivity tests and conduct a thorough analysis of the potential losses it could suffer. A CCP should evaluate the potential losses in individual participants’ positions and, where appropriate, their customers’ positions. Furthermore,  for  a  CCP  clearing  credit  instruments,  parameters  reflective  of  the simultaneous default of both participants and the underlying credit instruments should be considered. Sensitivity analysis should be performed on both actual and simulated positions. Rigorous sensitivity analysis of margin requirements may take on increased importance when markets are illiquid or volatile.

Any material revisions or adjustments to the methodology or parameters should be subject to appropriate governance processes (see also Principle 2 on governance) and validated prior to implementation. CCPs operating a cross-margining arrangement should also analyse the impact of cross-margining on prefunded default arrangements and evaluate the adequacy of overall financial resources. Also, the margin methodology, including the initial margin models and parameters used by a CCP, should be made as transparent as possible. At a minimum, the basic assumptions of the analytical method selected and the key data inputs should be disclosed to participants.

Depending on the design of an FMI, liquidity risk can arise between the FMI and its participants, between the FMI and other entities (such as its settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, and liquidity providers), or between participants in an FMI (such as in a DNS payment system or SSS). It is particularly important for an FMI to manage carefully its liquidity risk if, as is typical in many systems, the FMI relies on incoming payments from participants or other entities during the settlement process in order to make payments to other participants. If a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">participant or another entity fails to pay the FMI, the FMI may not have sufficient funds to meet its payment obligations to other participants. In such an event, the FMI would need to rely on its own liquidity resources (that is, liquid assets and prearranged funding arrangements) to cover the funds shortfall and complete settlement. An FMI should have a robust framework to manage its liquidity risks from the full range of participants and other entities. In some cases, a participant may play other roles within the FMI, such as a settlement or custodian bank or liquidity provider. These other roles should be considered in determining an FMI’s liquidity needs.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark143">&zwnj;</a>Sources of liquidity risk</p></li><li data-list-text="3.7.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should clearly identify its sources of liquidity risk and assess its current and potential future liquidity needs on a daily basis. An FMI can face liquidity risk from the default of a participant. For example, if an FMI extends intraday credit, implicitly or explicitly, to participants, such credit, even when fully collateralised, may create liquidity pressure in the event of a participant default. The FMI might not be able to convert quickly the defaulting participant’s collateral into cash at short notice. If an FMI does not have sufficient cash to meet all of its payment obligations to participants, there will be a settlement failure. An FMI can also face liquidity risk from its settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, and liquidity providers, as well as linked FMIs and service providers, if they fail to perform as expected. Moreover, as noted above, an FMI may face additional risk from entities that have multiple roles within the FMI (for example, a participant that also serves as the FMI’s settlement bank or liquidity provider). These interdependencies and the multiple roles that an entity may serve within an FMI should be taken into account by the FMI.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.7.3."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark360" class="a">An FMI that employs a DNS mechanism may create direct liquidity exposures between participants.

An FMI that employs a DNS mechanism may be able to reduce its or its participants’ liquidity risk by using alternative settlement designs, such as new RTGS designs with liquidity-saving features or a continuous or extremely frequent batch settlement system. In addition, it could reduce the liquidity demands of its participants by providing participants with sufficient information or control systems to help them manage their liquidity needs and risks. Furthermore, an FMI should ensure that it is operationally ready to manage the liquidity risk caused by participants’ or other entities’ financial or operational problems. Among other things, the FMI should have the operational capacity to reroute payments, where feasible, on a timely basis in case of problems with a correspondent bank.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.7.7."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI has other risk-management tools that it can use to manage its or, where relevant, its participants’ liquidity risk. To mitigate and manage liquidity risk stemming from a participant default, an FMI could use, either individually or in combination, exposure limits, collateral requirements, and prefunded default arrangements. To mitigate and manage liquidity risks from the late-day submission of payments or other transactions, an FMI could adopt rules or financial incentives for timely submission. To mitigate and manage liquidity risk stemming from a service provider or a linked FMI, an FMI could use, individually or in combination, selection criteria, concentration or exposure limits, and collateral requirements. For example, an FMI should seek to manage or diversify its settlement flows and liquid resources to avoid excessive intraday or overnight exposure to one entity. This, however, may involve trade-offs between the efficiency of relying on an entity and the risks of being overly dependent on that entity.

In addition, an FMI should regularly test its procedures for accessing its liquid resources at a liquidity provider, including by activating and drawing down test amounts from committed credit facilities and by testing operational procedures for conducting same-day repos.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark363" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" name="bookmark152">Central bank services</a><a href="#bookmark363" class="s8">83</a></p></li><li data-list-text="3.7.14."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If an FMI has access to central bank accounts, payment services, securities services, or collateral management services, it should use these services, where practical, to enhance its management of liquidity risk.

In other words, these tests identify how severe stress conditions would be covered by the FMI’s liquid resources. An FMI should judge whether it would be prudent to prepare for these severe conditions and various combinations of factors influencing these conditions. Reverse stress tests require an FMI to model extreme market conditions that may go beyond what are considered extreme but plausible market conditions in order to help understand the sufficiency of liquid resources given the underlying assumptions modelled. Modelling extreme market conditions can help an FMI determine the limits of its current model and resources; however, it requires the FMI to exercise judgment when modelling different markets and products. An FMI should develop hypothetical extreme scenarios and market conditions tailored to the specific risks of the markets and of the products it serves. Reverse stress tests should be considered a helpful risk-management tool but they need not, necessarily, drive an FMI’s determination of the appropriate level of liquid resources.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3.7.17."><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Frequency of stress testing. <span class="p">Liquidity stress testing should be performed on a daily basis using standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions.

An FMI should perform stress testing more frequently when markets are unusually volatile, when they are less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by its participants increases significantly.

These rules and procedures should address unforeseen and potentially uncovered liquidity shortfalls and should aim to avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations.

Any allocation rule or procedure must be discussed thoroughly with and communicated clearly to participants, as well as be consistent with participants’ respective regulatory liquidity risk-management requirements.

The legal basis governing the FMI, including the insolvency law, must acknowledge the discharge of a payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation between the FMI and system participants, or between or among participants, for the transaction to be considered final. An FMI should take reasonable steps to confirm the effectiveness of cross-border recognition and protection of cross-system settlement finality, especially when it is developing plans for recovery or orderly wind-down or providing relevant authorities information relating to its resolvability. Because of the complexity of legal frameworks and system rules, particularly in the context of cross- border settlement where legal frameworks are not harmonised, a well-reasoned legal opinion is generally necessary to establish the point at which finality takes place (see also Principle 1 on legal basis).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark160">&zwnj;</a>Same-day settlement</p></li><li data-list-text="3.8.5."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark373" class="a">An FMI’s processes should be designed to complete final settlement, at a minimum no later than the end of the value date. This means that any payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation that has been submitted to and accepted by an FMI in accordance with its risk management and other relevant acceptance criteria should be settled on the intended value date. An FMI that is not designed to provide final settlement on the value date (or same-day settlement) would not satisfy this principle, even if the transaction’s settlement date is adjusted back to the value date after settlement. This is because, in most of such arrangements, there is no certainty that final settlement will occur on the value date as expected. Further, deferral of final settlement to the next-business day can entail overnight risk exposures. For example, if an SSS or CCP conducts its money settlements using instruments or arrangements that involve next-day settlement, a participant’s default on its settlement obligations between the initiation and finality of settlement could pose significant credit and liquidity risks to the FMI and its other participants.</a><a href="#bookmark373" class="s8">91</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark161">&zwnj;</a>Intraday settlement</p></li><li data-list-text="3.8.6."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Depending on the type of obligations that an FMI settles, the use of intraday settlement, either in multiple batches or in real time, may be necessary or desirable to reduce</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark371">&zwnj;</a>89<span class="s10"> These fails typically occur because of miscommunication between the counterparties, operational problems in the delivery of securities, or failure to acquire a specific security associated with the trade by a specific point in time.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark372">&zwnj;</a>90<span class="s10"> In certain markets, participants may have adopted the convention of rescheduling delivery until the trade finally settles.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark373">&zwnj;</a>91<span class="s10"> In most cases, next-day settlements over weekend periods involve multi-day settlement risk.</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark374" class="a">settlement risk.</a>92<a href="#bookmark375" class="a"> As such, some types of FMIs, such as LVPSs and SSSs, should consider adopting RTGS or multiple-batch settlement to complete final settlement intraday.

Multiple-batch  settlement  based  on  a  DNS  mechanism,  for  example,  may  expose participants to settlement risks for the period during which settlement is deferred. These risks, if not sufficiently controlled, could result in the inability of one or more participants to meet their financial obligations. Conversely, while an RTGS system can mitigate or eliminate these settlement risks, it requires participants to have sufficient liquidity to cover all their outgoing payments and can therefore require relatively large amounts of intraday liquidity. This liquidity can come from various sources, including balances at a central bank or commercial bank, incoming payments, and intraday credit. An RTGS system may be able to reduce its liquidity needs by implementing a queuing facility or other liquidity-saving mechanisms.</a><a href="#bookmark377" class="s8">95</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark162">&zwnj;</a>Revocation of unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations</p></li><li data-list-text="3.8.8."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should clearly define the point after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be revoked by a participant.

In all cases, cutoff times and materiality rules for exceptions should be clearly defined.

Commercial bank money is a liability of a commercial bank, in the form of deposits held at the commercial bank, which can be used for settlement purposes. Settlement in commercial bank money typically occurs on the books of a commercial bank. In this model, an FMI typically establishes an account with one or more commercial settlement banks and requires each of its participants to establish an account with one of them. In some cases, the FMI itself can serve as the settlement bank. Money settlements are then effected through accounts on the books of the FMI, which may need to be funded and defunded.

When an FMI settles on its own books, participants face credit risk from the FMI itself. Liquidity risk may arise in money settlements if, after a payment obligation has been settled, participants or the FMI itself are unable to transfer readily their assets at the settlement bank into other liquid assets, such as claims on a central bank.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark167">&zwnj;</a>Central bank money</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.3."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should conduct its money settlements using central bank money, where practical and available, to avoid credit and liquidity risks. With the use of central bank money, a payment obligation is typically discharged by providing the FMI or its participants with a direct claim on the central bank, that is, the settlement asset is central bank money. Central banks have the lowest credit risk and are the source of liquidity with regard to their currency of issue. Indeed, one of the fundamental purposes of central banks is to provide a safe and liquid settlement asset. The use of central bank money, however, may not always be practical or available. For example, an FMI or its participants may not have direct access to all relevant central bank accounts and payment services. A multicurrency FMI that has access to all relevant central bank accounts and payment services may find that some central bank payment services do not operate, or provide finality, at the times when it needs to make money settlements.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark168">&zwnj;</a>Commercial bank money</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.4."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If central bank money is not used, an FMI should conduct its money settlements using a settlement asset with little or no credit or liquidity risk. An alternative to the use of central bank money is commercial bank money. When settling in commercial bank money, a payment obligation is typically discharged by providing the FMI or its participants with a direct claim on the relevant commercial bank. To conduct settlements in commercial bank money, an FMI and its participants need to establish accounts with at least one commercial bank, and likely hold intraday or overnight balances, or both. The use of commercial bank money to settle payment obligations, however, can create additional credit and liquidity risks for the FMI and its participants. For example, if the commercial bank conducting settlement becomes insolvent, the FMI and its participants may not have immediate access to their settlement funds or ultimately receive the full value of their funds.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.5."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If an FMI uses a commercial bank for its money settlements, it should monitor, manage, and limit its credit and liquidity risks arising from the commercial settlement bank. For example, an FMI should limit both the probability of being exposed to a commercial settlement bank’s failure and limit the potential losses and liquidity pressures to which it would be exposed in the event of such a failure. An FMI should establish and monitor adherence to strict criteria for its commercial settlement banks that take into account, among other things, their regulation and supervision, creditworthiness, capitalisation, access to liquidity, and operational reliability. A commercial settlement bank should be subject to effective banking regulation and supervision. It should also be creditworthy, be well capitalised, and have ample liquidity from the marketplace or the central bank of issue.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.6."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, an FMI should take further steps to limit its credit exposures and liquidity pressures by diversifying the risk of a commercial settlement bank failure, where reasonable, through use of multiple commercial settlement banks. In some jurisdictions, however, there may  be  only  one  commercial  settlement  bank  that  meets  appropriate  criteria  for</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark380" class="a">creditworthiness and operational reliability. Additionally, even with multiple commercial settlement banks, the extent to which risk is actually diversified depends upon the distribution or concentration of participants using different commercial settlement banks and the amounts owed by those participants.</a>97<span class="p"> An FMI should monitor and manage the full range and concentration of exposures to its commercial settlement banks and assess its potential losses and liquidity pressures as well as those of its participants in the event that the commercial settlement bank with the largest share of activity were to fail.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark169">&zwnj;</a>Settlement on the books of an FMI</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.7."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark381" class="a">If money settlement does not occur in central bank money and the FMI conducts money settlements on its own books, it should minimise and strictly control its credit and liquidity risks. In such an arrangement, an FMI offers cash accounts to its participants, and a payment or settlement obligation is discharged by providing an FMI’s participants with a direct claim on the FMI itself. The credit and liquidity risks associated with a claim on an FMI are therefore directly related to the FMI’s overall credit and liquidity risks. One way an FMI could minimise these risks is to limit its activities and operations to clearing and settlement and closely related processes. Further, to settle payment obligations, the FMI could be established as a supervised special-purpose financial institution and limit the provision of cash accounts to only participants.</a>98<span class="p"> In some cases, an FMI can further mitigate risk by having participants fund and defund their cash accounts at the FMI using central bank money. In such an arrangement, an FMI is able to back the settlements conducted on its own books with balances that it holds in its account at the central bank.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark170">&zwnj;</a>Finality of funds transfers between settlement accounts</p></li><li data-list-text="3.9.8."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In settlements involving either central bank or commercial bank money, a critical issue is the timing of the finality of funds transfers. These transfers should be final when effected (see also Principle 1 on legal basis and Principle 8 on settlement finality). To this end, an FMI’s legal agreements with any settlement banks should state clearly when transfers on the books of individual settlement banks are expected to occur, that transfers are to be final when effected, and that funds received should be transferable as soon as possible, at a minimum by the end of the day and ideally intraday, in order to enable the FMI and its participants to manage credit and liquidity risks. If an FMI conducts intraday money settlements (for example, to collect intraday margin), the arrangement should provide real- time finality or intraday finality at the times when an FMI wishes to effect money settlement.</p></li></ol></ol></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark380">&zwnj;</a>97<span class="s10"> The concentration of an FMI’s exposure to a commercial settlement bank can be further exacerbated if the commercial settlement bank has multiple roles with respect to the FMI. For example, an FMI may use a particular commercial settlement bank that is also a participant in the FMI for depositing and investing funds, for depositing and transferring securities, and for back-up liquidity resources.

In particular, an FMI should be clear whether the receiving participant should seek compensation from the FMI or the delivering participant in the event of a loss. Additionally, an FMI holding margin should not release the margin of the matched participants until it confirms that both have fulfilled their respective obligations.

A CSD should, in particular, maintain robust accounting practices and perform end-to-end auditing to verify that its records are accurate and provide a complete accounting of its securities issues. If a CSD records the issuance of securities (alone or in conjunction with other entities), it should verify and account for the initial issuance of securities and ensure that newly issued securities are delivered in a timely manner. To further safeguard the integrity of the securities issues, a CSD should conduct periodic and at least daily reconciliation of the totals of securities issues in the CSD for each issuer (or its issuing agent), and ensure that the total number of securities recorded in the CSD for a particular issue is equal to the amount of securities of that issue held on the CSD&#39;s books. Reconciliation may require coordination with other entities if the CSD does not (or does not exclusively) record the issuance of the security or is not the official registrar of the security. For instance, if the issuer (or its issuing agent) is the only entity that can verify the total amount of an individual issue, it is important that the CSD and the issuer cooperate closely to ensure that the securities in circulation in a system correspond to the volume issued into that system.

For example, a CSD that operates an SSS may provide a centralised securities lending facility to help facilitate timely settlement and reduce settlement fails or may otherwise offer services that support the bilateral securities lending market. If the CSD acts as a principal in a securities lending transaction, it should identify, monitor, and manage its risks, including potential credit and liquidity risks, under the conditions set in Principles 4 and 7. For example, the securities lent by the CSD may not be returned when needed because of a counterparty default, operational failure, or legal challenge.

Further, a settlement default could result in high replacement costs (that is, the unrealised gain on the unsettled contract or the cost of replacing the original contract at market prices that may be changing rapidly during periods of stress).

DvP, DvD, and PvP settlement mechanisms eliminate principal risk by ensuring that the final settlement of one obligation occurs if and only if the final settlement of the linked obligation occurs. If an FMI effects settlements using a DvP, DvD, or PvP settlement mechanism, it should settle a high percentage of obligations through that mechanism.

The rules of the FMI should specify the order in which different types of resources will be used. This information enables participants to assess their potential future exposures from using the FMI’s services.

Segregation of customers’ positions and collateral plays an important part in the safe and effective holding and transfer of customers’ positions and collateral, especially in the event of a participant’s default or insolvency. Segregation refers to a method of protecting customer collateral and contractual positions by holding or accounting for them separately. Customer collateral should be segregated from the assets of the participant through which the customers clear. In addition, individual customer collateral may be held separately from the collateral of other customers of the same participant to protect customers from each other’s default. Where offered by the CCP, such positions and collateral should be protected effectively from the concurrent default or insolvency of both a customer and the participant.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3.14.2  Effective segregation arrangements can reduce the impact of a participant’s insolvency on its customers by providing for clear and reliable identification of a participant’s customer’s positions and related collateral. Segregation also protects a customer’s collateral from becoming lost to a participant’s other creditors. In addition, segregation facilitates the transfer of customers’ positions and collateral. Even if no transfers take place, segregation can improve a customer’s ability to identify and recover its collateral (or the value thereof), which, at least to some extent, contributes to retaining customers’ confidence in their clearing participants and may reduce the potential for “counterparty runs” on a deteriorating clearing participant.</p><ol id="l62"><ol id="l63"><ol id="l64"><li data-list-text="3.14.3."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Portability refers to the operational aspects of the transfer of contractual positions, funds, or securities from one party to another party. By facilitating transfers from one participant to another, effective portability arrangements lessen the need for closing out positions, including during times of market stress. Portability thus minimises the costs and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">potential market disruption associated with closing out positions and reduces the possible impact on customers’ ability to continue to obtain access to central clearing.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.14.4."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark410" class="a">Effective segregation and portability of a participant’s customers’ positions and collateral depend not only on the measures taken by a CCP itself but also on applicable legal frameworks, including those in foreign jurisdictions in the case of remote participants.

The relevant legal framework will vary depending upon many factors, including the participant’s legal form of organisation, the manner in which collateral is provided (for example, security interest, title transfer, or full ownership right), and the types of assets (for example, cash or securities) provided as collateral. Therefore, it is not possible to design a single model appropriate for all CCPs across all jurisdictions. However, a CCP should structure its segregation and portability arrangements (including applicable rules) in a manner that protects the interests of a participant’s customers and achieves a high degree of legal certainty under applicable law. A CCP should also consider potential conflict of laws when designing its arrangements. In particular, the CCP’s rules and procedures that set out its segregation and portability arrangements should avoid any potential conflict with applicable legal or regulatory requirements.</span></p></li></ol></ol></ol><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark206">&zwnj;</a>Alternate approach for CCPs serving certain cash markets</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark412" class="a">3.14.6  In certain jurisdictions, cash market CCPs operate in legal regimes that facilitate segregation and portability to achieve protection of customer assets by alternate means that offer the same degree of protection as the approach required by this principle. Features of these regimes are that if a participant fails, (a) the customer positions can be identified timely, (b) customers will be protected by an investor protection scheme designed to move customer accounts from the failed or failing participant to another participant in a timely manner, and (c) customer assets can be restored.</a>122<span class="p"> In these cases, the CCP and relevant authorities for these particular cash markets should evaluate whether the applicable legal or regulatory framework achieves the same degree of protection and efficiency (see Principle 21 on efficiency and effectiveness) for customers that would otherwise be achieved by segregation and portability arrangements at the CCP level described in Principle 14.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark410">&zwnj;</a>120<span class="s10"> Participants may collect excess collateral from their customers, beyond that which is required by and provided to the CCP.

Under these regimes, pending securities purchases do not belong to the customer; thus, there is no customer trade or position entered into the CCP. As a result, participants provide collateral to the CCP on behalf of their customers regardless of whether they are acting on a principal or agent basis, and the CCP is not able to identify positions or possess the assets of its participants’ customers.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark207">&zwnj;</a>Customer account structures</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3.14.7.  The segregation and portability principle is particularly relevant for CCPs that clear positions and hold collateral belonging to customers of a participant. This clearing structure allows customers (such as buy-side firms) that are not direct participants of a CCP to obtain access to central clearing where direct access is either not possible (for example, due to an inability to meet membership criteria) or not considered commercially appropriate (for example, due to the cost of establishing and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to perform as a clearing member or contributing to a CCP’s default resources). A CCP should employ an account structure that enables it readily to identify positions belonging to a participant’s customers and to segregate related collateral. Segregation of customer collateral by a CCP can be achieved in different ways, including through individual or omnibus accounts.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark413" class="a">3.14.8  The degree of protection achievable for customer collateral will depend on whether customers are protected on an individual or omnibus basis and the way initial margin is collected (gross or net basis) by the CCP.</a>123<a href="#bookmark414" class="a"> Each of these decisions will have implications for the risks the CCP faces from its participants and, in some cases, their customers.

Under this approach, each customer’s collateral is held in a separate, segregated individual account at the CCP, and depending on the legal framework applicable to the CCP, a customer’s collateral may only be used to cover losses associated with the default of that customer (that is, customer collateral is protected on an individual basis). This account structure facilitates the clear and reliable identification of a customer’s collateral, which supports full portability of an individual customer’s positions and collateral or, alternatively, can expedite the return of collateral to the customer. Since all collateral maintained in the individual customer’s account is used to margin that customer’s positions only, the CCP should be able to transfer these positions from the customer account of a defaulting participant to that of another participant with sufficient collateral to cover the exposures. The use of individual accounts and the collection of margin on a gross basis provide flexibility in how a customer’s portfolio may be ported to another participant or group of participants.</a>125<span class="p"> Maintaining individual accounts, however, can be operationally and resource intensive for the CCP in settling transactions and ensuring accurate bookkeeping. This approach could impact the overall efficiency of the CCP’s operations.

This approach can be less operationally intensive, can be more efficient when porting positions and collateral for a group of customers of a defaulting participant (where there has been no customer default or where customer collateral is legally protected on an individual basis), and can be structured to protect customers’ collateral from being used to cover a default by the direct participant.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.14.11."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark416" class="a">However, depending on the legal framework and the CCP’s rules, omnibus accounts where the customer collateral is protected on an omnibus basis may expose a customer to “fellow-customer risk” – the risk that another customer of the same participant will default and create a loss that exceeds both the amount of available collateral supporting the defaulting customer’s positions and the available resources of the participant.</a>126<span class="p"> As a result, the remaining commingled collateral of the participant’s non-defaulting customers is exposed to the loss.

Such individual protection does require the CCP to maintain accurate books sufficient to promptly ascertain an individual customer’s interest in a portion of the collateral.

As with account structure, there are advantages and disadvantages to the alternative ways in which margin may be collected by the CCP that employs an omnibus account structure. Margin calculated on a gross basis to support individual customer portfolios results in less netting efficiency at the participant level; however, it is likely to preclude the possibility of under-margined customer positions when ported. As a result, CCPs can port a participant’s customers’ positions and related margin in bulk or piecemeal.</a>128<span class="p"> Gross margining enhances the feasibility of portability, which is desirable since porting avoids the transactions costs, including bid-offer spreads associated with terminating and replacing a participant’s customers’ positions.

In order to achieve a high likelihood of portability, a CCP will need to have the ability to identify positions that belong to customers, identify and assert its rights to related collateral held by or through the CCP, transfer positions and related collateral to one or more other participants, identify potential participants to accept the positions, disclose relevant information to such participants so that they can evaluate the counterparty credit and market risk associated with the customers and positions, respectively, and facilitate the CCP’s ability to carry out its default management procedures in an orderly manner. A CCP’s rules and procedures should require participants to facilitate the transfer of a participant’s customers’ positions and collateral upon the customer’s request, subject to any notice or other contractual requirements. The CCP should obtain the consent of the direct participant to which positions and collateral are ported.

An FMI should assess and thoroughly understand its business risk and the potential effect that this risk could have on its cash flows, liquidity, and capital positions. In doing so, an FMI should consider a combination of tools, such as risk management and internal control assessments, scenario analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Internal control assessments should identify key risks and controls and assess the impact and probability of the risks and the effectiveness of the controls. Scenario analysis should examine how specific scenarios would affect the FMI. Sensitivity analysis should test how changes in one risk affect the FMI’s financial standing, for example, conducting the analysis of how the loss of a key customer or service provider might impact the FMI’s existing business activities. In some cases, an FMI may want to consider an independent assessment of specific business risks.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.15.3."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should clearly understand its general business risk profile so that it is able to assess its ability either (a) to avoid, reduce, or transfer specific business risks or (b) to accept and manage those risks. This requires the ongoing identification of risk-mitigation options that the FMI may use in response to changes in its business environment. When planning an expansion of activity, an FMI should conduct a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment. In particular, when considering any major new product, service, or project, the FMI should project potential revenues and expenses as well as identify and plan how it will cover any additional capital requirements. Further, an FMI may eliminate or mitigate some risks by instituting appropriate internal controls or by obtaining insurance or indemnity from a third party.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark218">&zwnj;</a>Measuring and monitoring business risk</p></li><li data-list-text="3.15.4."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once an FMI has identified and assessed its business risk, it should measure and monitor these risks on an ongoing basis and develop appropriate information systems as part of a robust enterprise risk-management program. Key components of a robust enterprise risk-management program include establishing strong financial and internal control systems so that the FMI can monitor, manage, and control its cash flows and operating expenses and mitigate any business-related losses (see Principle 3 on framework for the comprehensive management of risks). In particular, an FMI should minimise and mitigate the probability of business-related losses and their impact on its operations across a range of adverse business and market conditions, including the scenario that its viability as a going concern is questioned.

Custody risk is the risk of loss on assets held in custody in the event of a custodian’s (or subcustodian’s) insolvency, negligence, fraud, poor administration, or inadequate recordkeeping. Assets that are used by an FMI to support its operating funds or capital funds or that have been provided by participants to secure their obligations to the FMI should be held at supervised or regulated entities that have strong processes, systems, and credit profiles, including other FMIs (for example, CSDs). In addition, assets should generally be held in a manner that assures the FMI of prompt access to those assets in the event that the FMI needs to draw on them. Investment risk refers to the risk of loss faced by an FMI when it invests its own or its participants’ assets.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark224">&zwnj;</a>Use of custodians</p></li><li data-list-text="3.16.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should mitigate its custody risk by using only supervised and regulated entities with robust accounting practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls that fully protect its own and its participants’ assets. It is particularly important that assets held in custody are protected against claims of a custodian’s creditors. The custodian should have a sound legal basis supporting its activities, including the segregation of assets (see also Principle 1 on legal basis and Principle 11 on CSDs). The custodian also should have a strong financial position to be able to sustain losses from operational problems or non- custodial activities. An FMI should confirm that its interest or ownership rights in the assets can be enforced and that it can have prompt access to its assets and the assets provided by participants, when required. Timely availability and access should be ensured even if these securities are held in another time zone or jurisdiction. Furthermore, the FMI should confirm it has prompt access to the assets in the event of a default of a participant.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.16.3."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should evaluate and understand its exposures to its custodian banks, taking into account the full scope of its relationships with each custodian bank. For example, a financial institution may serve as a custodian bank to an FMI as well as a settlement bank and liquidity provider to the FMI. The custodian bank also might be a participant in the FMI and offer clearing services to other participants. An FMI should carefully consider all of its relationships with a particular custodian bank to ensure that its overall risk exposure to an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">individual custodian remains within acceptable concentration limits. Where feasible, an FMI could consider using multiple custodians for the safekeeping of its assets to diversify its exposure to any single custodian. For example, a CCP may want to use one custodian for its margin assets and another custodian for its prefunded default arrangement. Such a CCP, however, may need to balance the benefits of risk diversification against the benefits of pooling resources at one or a small number of custodians. In any event, an FMI should monitor the concentration of risk exposures to, and financial condition of, its custodian banks on an ongoing basis.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark225">&zwnj;</a>Investment strategy</p></li><li data-list-text="3.16.4."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI’s strategy for investing its own and its participants’ assets should be consistent with its overall risk-management strategy and fully disclosed to its participants. When making its investment choices, the FMI should not allow pursuit of profit to compromise its financial soundness and liquidity risk management. Investments should be secured by, or be claims on, high-quality obligors to mitigate the credit risk to which the FMI is exposed. Also, because the value of an FMI’s investments may need to be realised quickly, investments should allow for quick liquidation with little, if any, adverse price effect. For example, an FMI could invest in overnight reverse repo agreements backed by liquid securities with low credit risk. An FMI should carefully consider its overall credit risk exposures to individual obligors, including other relationships with the obligor that create additional exposures such as an obligor that is also a participant or an affiliate of a participant in the FMI. In addition, an FMI should not invest participant assets in the participant’s own securities or those of its affiliates. If an FMI’s own resources can be used to cover losses and liquidity pressures resulting from a participant default, the investment of those resources should not compromise the FMI’s ability to use them when needed.</p></li></ol></ol></ol><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark226">&zwnj;</a>Principle 17: Operational risk<a name="bookmark432">&zwnj;</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls.

As part of an FMI’s operational risk-management framework, the FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk; deploy appropriate systems; establish appropriate policies, procedures, and controls; set operational reliability objectives; and develop a business continuity plan. An FMI should take a holistic approach when establishing its operational risk-management framework.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark229">&zwnj;</a>Identifying sources of operational risk</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.2."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark433" class="a">An FMI should actively identify, monitor, and manage the plausible sources of operational risk and establish clear policies and procedures to address them. Operational risk can stem from both internal and external sources. Internal sources of operational risk include inadequate identification or understanding of risks and the controls and procedures needed to limit and manage them, inadequate control of systems and processes, inadequate screening of personnel, and, more generally, inadequate management. External sources of operational risk include the failure of critical service providers or utilities or events affecting a wide metropolitan area such as natural disasters, terrorism, and pandemics. Both internal and external sources of operational risk can lead to a variety of operational failures that include (a) errors or delays in message handling, (b) miscommunication, (c) service degradation or interruption, (d) fraudulent activities by staff, and (e) disclosure of confidential information to unauthorised entities. If an FMI provides services in multiple time zones, it may face increased operational risk due to longer operational hours and less downtime for maintenance. An FMI should identify all potential single points of failure in its operations.</a>139<span class="p"> Additionally, an FMI should assess the evolving nature of the operational risk it faces on an ongoing basis (for example, pandemics and cyber-attacks), so that it can analyse its potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate defence mechanisms.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.3."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark434" class="a">A TR typically serves as a single source of information for a particular market, and it may be the central registry for certain trades. Therefore, a TR’s failure to perform as expected could cause significant disruption. The key risk of a TR is operational. Deficiencies in business continuity management, data integrity, and the safeguarding of data are a particular concern. Inadequate disclosure or faulty delivery of data by a TR to relevant authorities or the public could undermine the primary purpose of the TR. Access to timely and reliable data provides greater insights into the derivatives market and improves the ability of relevant authorities to oversee the markets it serves and its participants. Data recorded by a TR may also be used as inputs by the TR’s participants and potentially by other relevant infrastructures and service providers. Therefore, continuous availability of data stored in a TR is critical.</a>140<span class="p"> Also, a TR should carefully assess the additional operational risks related to its links to ensure the scalability and reliability of IT and related resources. Where a TR provides access to another type of FMI, such as a CCP, the linked FMIs may be exposed to additional risks if the interface is not properly designed. FMIs establishing a link to a TR should ensure that the system and communication arrangements between the linked entities are reliable and secure such that the operation of the link does not pose significant reliability and security risks.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark230">&zwnj;</a>Operational risk management</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.4."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should establish clear policies, procedures, and controls that mitigate and manage its sources of operational risk. Overall, operational risk management is a continuous process encompassing risk assessment, defining an acceptable tolerance for risk, and implementing risk controls. This process results in an FMI accepting, mitigating, or avoiding risks consistent with its operational reliability objectives. An FMI’s governance arrangements are pertinent to its operational risk-management framework (see also Principle 2 on governance).

For example, an FMI should have adequate management controls, such as setting operational standards, measuring and reviewing performance, and correcting deficiencies. There are many relevant international, national, and industry-level standards, guidelines, or recommendations that an FMI may use in designing its operational risk- management framework. Conformity with commercial standards can help an FMI reach its operational objectives. For example, commercial standards exist for information security, business continuity, and project management. An FMI should regularly assess the need to integrate  the  applicable  commercial  standards  into  its  operational  risk-management framework. In addition, an FMI should seek to comply with relevant commercial standards in a manner commensurate with the FMI’s importance and level of interconnectedness.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.6."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI’s arrangements with participants, operational policies, and operational procedures should be periodically, and whenever necessary, tested and reviewed, especially after significant changes occur to the system or a major incident occurs. In order to minimise any effects of the testing on operations, tests should be carried out in a “testing environment.” This testing environment should, to the extent possible, replicate the production environment (including the implemented security provisions, in particular, those regarding data confidentiality). Additionally, key elements of an FMI’s operational risk- management framework should be audited periodically and whenever necessary. In addition to periodic internal audits, external audits may be necessary, depending on the FMI’s importance and level of interconnectedness.

An FMI’s personnel should be able to operate the system safely and efficiently and consistently follow operational and risk-management procedures during normal and abnormal circumstances. An FMI should implement appropriate human resources policies to hire, train, and retain qualified personnel, thereby mitigating the effects of high rates of personnel turnover or key-person risk.

Change-management processes should provide mechanisms for preparing, approving, tracking, testing, and implementing all changes to the system. Project-management processes, in the form of policies and procedures, should mitigate the risk of any inadvertent effects on an FMI’s current or future activities due to an upgrade, expansion, or alteration to its service offerings, especially for major projects. In particular, these policies and procedures should guide the management,  documentation,  governance,  communication,  and  testing  of  projects, regardless of whether projects are outsourced or executed in-house.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark231">&zwnj;</a>Operational reliability</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.9."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have clearly defined operational reliability objectives and should have policies in place that are designed to achieve those objectives.

A TR, in particular, should have scalable capacity adequate to maintain historical data as required. Capacity management requires that the FMI monitor, review, and test (including stress test) the actual capacity and performance of the system on an ongoing basis. The FMI should carefully forecast demand and make appropriate plans to adapt to any plausible change in the volume of business or technical requirements. These plans should be based on  a  sound,  comprehensive  methodology  so  that  the  required  service  levels  and performance can be achieved and maintained. As part of its capacity planning, an FMI should determine a required level of redundant capacity, taking into account the FMI’s level of importance and interconnectedness, so that if an operational outage occurs, the system is able to resume operations and process all remaining transactions before the end of the day.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark234">&zwnj;</a>Physical and information security</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.12."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should have comprehensive physical and information security policies that address all potential vulnerabilities and threats.

An FMI also should have sound and robust information security policies, standards, practices, and controls to ensure an appropriate level of confidence and trust in the FMI by all stakeholders. These policies, standards, practices, and controls should include the identification, assessment, and management of security threats and vulnerabilities for the purpose of implementing appropriate safeguards into its systems.

A business continuity plan should have clearly stated objectives and should include policies and procedures that allow for the rapid recovery and timely resumption of critical operations following a disruption to a service, including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption. An FMI should explicitly assign responsibility for business continuity planning and devote adequate resources to this planning. The plan should identify and address events that pose a significant risk of disrupting operations, including events that could cause a wide-scale or major disruption, and should focus on the impact on the operation of critical infrastructures and services. An FMI’s business continuity plan should</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ensure that the FMI can continue to meet agreed-upon service levels in such events.

Communication with regulators, supervisors, and overseers is critical in case of a major disruption to an FMI’s operations or a wider market distress that affects the FMI, particularly where relevant authorities might rely on data held by the FMI for crisis management. Depending on the nature of the problem, communication channels with local civil authorities (for physical attacks or natural disasters) or computer experts (for software malfunctions or cyber-attacks) may also need to be activated.

Accordingly, the FMI should identify both direct and indirect effects on its ability to process and settle transactions in the normal course of business and manage risks that stem from an external operational failure of connected entities. These effects include those transmitted through its participants, which may participate in multiple FMIs. In addition, an FMI should also identify, monitor, and manage the risks it faces from and poses to other FMIs (see Principle 20 on FMI links). To the extent possible, interdependent FMIs should coordinate business continuity arrangements. An FMI also should consider the risks associated with its service and utility providers and the operational effect on the FMI if service or utility providers fail to perform as expected. An FMI should provide reliable service, not only for the benefit of its direct participants, but also for all entities that would be affected by its ability to process transactions.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17.19."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To manage the operational risks associated with its participants, an FMI should consider establishing minimum operational requirements for its participants (see also Principle 18 on access and participation requirements). For example, an FMI may want to define operational and business continuity requirements for participants in accordance with the participant’s role and importance to the system. In some cases, an FMI may want to identify critical participants based on the consideration of transaction volumes and values, services provided to the FMI and other interdependent systems, and, more generally, the potential impact on other participants and the system as a whole in the event of a significant operational problem. Critical participants may need to meet some of the same operational risk-management requirements as the FMI itself.

In particular, limiting access to an FMI’s services may disadvantage some market participants (and their customers), other FMIs (for example, a CCP that needs access to a CSD), and service providers that do not have access to the FMI’s services. Further, access to one or more FMIs may play an important role in a marketwide plan or policy for the safe and efficient clearing of certain classes of financial instruments and the promotion of efficient financial markets (including the reporting and recording of transaction data). An FMI’s participation requirements should therefore allow for fair and open access, in all relevant jurisdictions, based on reasonable risk-related  participation  requirements.

Access is critical for participants reporting trade information to the TR and for platforms that may submit transaction data on behalf of participants, including exchanges, electronic trading venues, and confirmation or matching service providers.

Accordingly, an FMI should establish risk-related participation requirements adequate to ensure that its participants meet appropriate operational, financial, and legal requirements to allow them to fulfil their obligations to the FMI, including the other participants, on a timely basis. Where participants act for other entities (indirect participants), it may be appropriate for the FMI to impose additional requirements to ensure that the direct participants have the capacity to do so (see also Principle 19 on tiered participation arrangements). Operational requirements may include reasonable criteria relating to the participant’s ability and readiness (for example, its IT capabilities) to use an FMI’s services. Financial requirements may include reasonable risk- related  capital  requirements,  contributions  to  prefunded  default  arrangements,  and appropriate indicators of creditworthiness. Legal requirements may include appropriate licences and authorisations to conduct relevant activities as well as legal opinions or other arrangements that demonstrate that possible conflict of laws issues would not impede the ability of an applicant (for example, a foreign entity) to meet its obligations to the FMI. An FMI also may require participants to have appropriate risk-management expertise. If an FMI admits non-regulated entities, it should take into account any additional risks that may arise from their participation and design its participation requirements and risk-management controls accordingly.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.18.6."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark441" class="a">An FMI’s participation requirements should be justified in terms of the safety and efficiency of the FMI and the markets it serves, be tailored to the FMI’s specific risks, be imposed in a manner commensurate with such risks, and be publicly disclosed.</a>145<a href="#bookmark442" class="a"> The requirements should be objective and should not unnecessarily discriminate against particular  classes  of  participants  or  introduce  competitive  distortions.  For  example, participation requirements based solely on a participant’s size are typically insufficiently related to risk and deserve careful scrutiny. Subject to maintaining acceptable risk control standards, an FMI should endeavour to set requirements that have the least-restrictive impact on access that circumstances permit. While restrictions on access should generally be based on reasonable risk-related criteria, such restrictions may also be subject to the constraints of local laws and policies of the jurisdiction in which the FMI operates.</a>146<span class="p"> Requirements should also reflect the risk profile of the activity; an FMI may have different categories of participation based on the type of activity.

For example, an FMI can use credit limits or collateral requirements to help it manage its credit exposure to a particular participant. The permitted level of participation may be different for participants maintaining different levels of capital. Where other factors are equal, participants holding greater levels of capital may be permitted less-restrictive risk limits or be able to participate in more functions within the FMI. The effectiveness of such risk-management controls may mitigate the need for an FMI to impose onerous participation requirements that limit access. An FMI could also differentiate its services to provide different levels of access at varying levels of cost and complexity. For example, an FMI may want to limit direct participation to certain types of entities and provide indirect access to others.</a>147<span class="p"> Participation requirements (and other risk controls) can be tailored to each tier of participants based on the risks each tier poses to the FMI and its participants.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark244">&zwnj;</a>Monitoring</p></li><li data-list-text="3.18.8."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An FMI should monitor compliance with its participation requirements on an ongoing basis through the receipt of timely and accurate information.

An FMI is not expected to manage the credit and liquidity exposures between direct and indirect participants, although the FMI may have a role in applying credit or position limits in agreement with the direct participant. An FMI should, however, have access to information on concentrations of risk arising from tiered participation arrangements that may affect the FMI, allowing it to identify indirect participants responsible for a significant proportion of the FMI’s transactions or whose transaction volumes or values are large relative to those of the direct participants through which they access the FMI.

An FMI should ensure that a default, whether by a direct participant or by an indirect participant, does not affect the finality of indirect participants’ transactions that have been processed and settled by the FMI. An FMI should ensure that its rules and procedures are clear regarding the status of indirect participants’ transactions at each point in the settlement process (including the point at which they become subject to the rules of the system and the point after which the rules of the system no longer apply) and whether such transactions would be settled in the event of an indirect or direct participant default. An FMI should also ensure that it adequately understands its direct participants&#39; processes and procedures for managing an indirect participant’s default. For example, the FMI should know whether the indirect participant’s queued payments can be removed or future-dated transactions rescinded and whether such processes and procedures would expose the FMI to operational, reputational, or other risks.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark252">&zwnj;</a>Encouraging direct participation</p></li><li data-list-text="3.19.11."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Direct participation in an FMI usually provides a number of benefits, some of which may not be available to indirect participants, such as real-time gross settlement, exchange-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark450" class="a">of-value settlement, or settlement in central bank money. Moreover, indirect participants are vulnerable to the risk that their access to an FMI, their ability to make and receive payments and their ability to undertake and settle other transactions is lost if the direct participant on whom these indirect participants rely defaults or declines to continue their business relationship. If these indirect participants have large values or volumes of business through the FMI, this may affect the smooth functioning of the FMI. For these reasons, where an indirect participant accounts for a large proportion of the transactions processed by an FMI, it may be appropriate to encourage direct participation. For example, an FMI may in some cases establish objective thresholds above which direct participation would normally be encouraged (provided that the firm satisfies the FMI’s access criteria).

The type and degree of risk varies according to the design and complexity of the FMIs and the nature of the relationship between them. In a simple case of a vertical link, for example, an FMI may provide basic services to another FMI, such as a CSD that provides securities transfer services to an SSS. Such links typically pose only operational and custody risks. Other links, such as an arrangement in which a CCP provides clearing services to another CCP, may be more complex and may pose additional risk to FMIs, such as credit and liquidity risk.</a>158<span class="p"> Cross-margining by two or more CCPs may also pose additional risk because the CCPs may rely on each other’s risk-management systems to measure, monitor, and manage credit and liquidity risk (see Principle 6 on margin). In addition, links between different types of FMIs may pose specific risks to one or all of the FMIs in the link arrangement. For example, a CCP may have a link with a CSD that operates an SSS for the delivery of securities and settlement of margins. If the CCP poses risks to the CSD, the CSD should manage those risks.

To limit these uncertainties, the respective rights and obligations of the linked FMIs and, where necessary, their participants should be clearly defined in the link agreement.

In particular, FMIs should ensure that risk- management arrangements and processing capacity are sufficiently scalable and reliable to operate the link safely for both the current and projected peak volumes of activity processed over  the  link  (see  Principle  17  on  operational  risk).  Systems  and  communication arrangements between linked FMIs also should be reliable and secure so that the link does not pose significant operational risk to the linked FMIs. Any reliance by a linked FMI on a critical service provider should be disclosed as appropriate to the other FMI. In addition, a linked FMI should identify, monitor, and manage operational risks due to complexities or inefficiencies associated with differences in time zones, particularly as these affect staff availability. Governance arrangements and change-management processes should ensure that changes in one FMI will not inhibit the smooth functioning of the link, related risk- management arrangements, or non-discriminatory access to the link (see Principle 2 on governance and Principle 18 on access and participation requirements).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark260">&zwnj;</a>Managing financial risk</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.5."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FMIs in a link arrangement should effectively measure, monitor, and manage their financial risk, including custody risk, arising from the link arrangement.

If such a link is improperly designed, the settlement of transactions across the link could subject participants to new or increased risks. In addition to legal and operational risks, linked CSDs and their participants could also face credit and liquidity risks. For example, an operational failure or default in one CSD may cause settlement failures or defaults in a linked CSD and expose participants in the linked CSD, including participants that did not settle transactions across the link, to unexpected liquidity pressures or outright losses. A CSD’s default  procedures,  for  example,  could  affect  a  linked  CSD  through  loss-sharing arrangements. Linked CSDs should identify, monitor, and manage the credit and liquidity risks arising from the linked entity.

In particular, the investor CSD should use issuer CSDs that provide adequate protection of assets in the event that the issuer CSD becomes insolvent (see Principle 11 on CSDs). In some cases, securities held by an investor CSD can be subject to attachment by the creditors of the CSD or its participants and, as such, can also be subject to freezing or blocking instructions from local courts or other authorities. Further, if an investor CSD maintains securities in an omnibus account at an issuer CSD and a participant at the investor CSD defaults, the investor CSD should not use the securities belonging to other participants to settle subsequent local deliveries of the defaulting participant. The investor CSD should have adequate measures and procedures to avoid effects on the use of securities belonging to non-defaulting participants in a participant-default scenario.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.8."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, linked CSDs should have robust reconciliation procedures to ensure that their respective records are accurate and current. Reconciliation is a procedure to verify that the records held by the linked CSDs match for transactions processed across the link. This process is particularly important when three or more CSDs are involved in settling transactions (that is, the securities are held in safekeeping by one CSD or custodian while the seller and the buyer participate in one or more of the linked CSDs) (see also Principle 11 on CSDs).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark262">&zwnj;</a>Indirect CSD-CSD links</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.9."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If an investor CSD uses an intermediary to operate a link with an issuer CSD, the investor CSD should measure, monitor, and manage the additional risks (including custody, credit, legal, and operational risks) arising from the use of the intermediary. In an indirect CSD-CSD link, an investor CSD uses an intermediary (such as a custodian bank) to access the issuer CSD. In such cases, the investor CSD faces the risk that the custodian bank may become insolvent, act negligently, or commit fraud. Although an investor CSD may not face a loss on the value of the securities, the ability of the investor CSD to use its securities might temporarily be impaired. The investor CSD should measure, monitor, and manage on an ongoing basis its custody risk (see also Principle 16 on custody and investment risks) and provide evidence to the relevant authorities that adequate measures have been adopted to mitigate this custody risk. In addition, the investor CSD should ensure that it has adequate legal, contractual, and operational protections to ensure that its assets held in custody are segregated and transferable (see Principle 11 on CSDs). Similarly, an investor CSD should ensure that its settlement banks or cash correspondents can perform as expected. In that context, the investor CSD should have adequate information on the business continuity plans of its intermediary and the issuer CSD to achieve a high degree of confidence that both entities will perform as expected during a disruptive event.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark263">&zwnj;</a>CCP-CCP links</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.10."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP may establish links with one or more other CCPs. Although the details of individual link arrangements among CCPs differ significantly because of the varied designs of CCPs and the markets they serve, there are currently two basic types of CCP links: peer- to-peer links and participant links.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.11."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a peer-to-peer link, a CCP maintains special arrangements with another CCP and is not subject to normal participant rules. Typically, however, the CCPs exchange margin and other financial resources on a reciprocal basis. The linked CCPs face current and potential future exposures to each other as a result of the process whereby they each net the trades cleared between their participants so as to create novated (net) positions between the CCPs. Risk management between the CCPs is based on a bilaterally approved framework, which is different from that applied to a normal participant.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.12."><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a participant link, one CCP (the participant CCP) is a participant in another CCP (the host CCP) and is subject to the host CCP’s normal participant rules. In such cases, the host CCP maintains an account for the participant CCP and would typically require the participant CCP to provide margin, as would be the case for a participant that is not a CCP. A participant CCP should mitigate and manage its risk from the link separately from the risks in its core clearing and settlement activities. For example, if the host CCP defaults, the participant CCP may not have adequate protection because the participant CCP does not hold collateral from the host CCP to mitigate the counterparty risk posed to it by the host CCP. Risk protection in a participant link is one-way, unlike in a peer-to-peer link. The participant CCP that provides margin but does not collect margin from another linked CCP should therefore hold additional financial resources to protect itself against the default of the host CCP.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.13."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both types of links – peer-to-peer and participant links – may present new or increased risks that should be measured, monitored, and managed by the CCPs involved in the link. The most challenging issue with respect to CCP links is the risk management of the financial exposures that potentially arise from the link arrangement. Before entering into a link with another CCP, a CCP should identify and assess the potential spillover effects from the default of the linked CCP. If a link has three or more CCPs, each CCP should identify and assess the risks of the collective link arrangement. A network of links between CCPs that does not properly acknowledge and address the inherent complexity of multi-CCP links could have significant implications for systemic risk.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.14."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exposures faced by one CCP from a linked CCP should be identified, monitored, and managed with the same rigour as exposures from a CCP’s participants to prevent a default at one CCP from triggering a default at a linked CCP. Such exposures should be covered fully, primarily through the use of margin or other equivalent financial resources. In particular, each CCP in a CCP link arrangement should be able to cover, at least on a daily basis, its current and potential future exposures to the linked CCP and its participants, if any, fully with a high degree of confidence without reducing the CCP’s ability to fulfil its obligations to its own participants at any time (see Principle 6 on margin). Financial resources used to cover inter-CCP current exposures should be prefunded with highly liquid assets that exhibit low credit risk. Best practice is for CCPs to have near real time inter-CCP risk management. However, at a minimum, financial exposures among linked CCPs should be marked to market and covered on a daily basis. CCPs also need to consider and address the risks arising from links in designing their stress tests and calibrating their prefunded default arrangements.  Linked CCPs should also take into account the effects that possible contributions to each other’s prefunded default arrangements, exchange of margin, common participants, major differences in their risk-management tools, and other relevant features may have on their risk-management frameworks, especially in relation to the legal, credit, liquidity, and operational risks they face.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.15."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of the different possible types of link arrangements, different types of CCPs, and differences in the legal and regulatory frameworks in which CCPs may operate, different combinations of risk-management tools may be used by the CCP. When linked CCPs have materially different risk-management frameworks, the risks stemming from the link are more complex. In this case, the linked CCPs should carefully assess the effectiveness of their risk-management models and methodologies, including their default procedures, in order to determine whether and to what extent their inter-CCP risk- management frameworks should be harmonised or whether additional risk-mitigation measures would be sufficient to mitigate risks arising from the link.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.16."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP (the first CCP) will usually have to provide margin to a linked CCP for open positions. In some cases, the first CCP may not be able to provide margin that it has collected from its participants to the linked CCP because the first CCP’s rules may prohibit the use of its participants’ margin for any purpose other than to cover losses from a default of a participant in the first CCP, or the first CCP’s legal or regulatory requirements may not</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">permit such reuse of its participants’ collateral. As such, the CCP would need to use alternative financial resources to cover its counterparty risk to the linked CCP, which is normally covered by margin. If a CCP is allowed to reuse its participants’ collateral to meet an inter-CCP margin requirement, such collateral provided by the first CCP must be unencumbered and its use by the linked CCP in the event of the default of the first CCP must not be constrainable by actions taken by the participants of the first CCP. The credit and liquidity risk arising from the reuse of margin should be adequately mitigated by the CCPs. This can be achieved through segregation, protection, and custody of margin exchanged between CCPs in a manner that allows for its swift and timely return to the CCP in case of a decrease in the exposures and that allows for supplemental margin (and, if necessary, supplemental default fund contributions) needed to cover the counterparty risk between the linked CCPs to be charged directly to the participants who use the link service, if applicable.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.17."><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark458" class="a">Linked CCPs should maintain arrangements that are effective in managing the risks arising from the link; such arrangements often involve a separate default fund to cover that risk. In principle, the risk-management measures related to the link should not reduce the resources that a CCP holds to address other risks. The most direct way to achieve this outcome is for CCPs not to participate in each other’s default funds, which may in turn mean that the CCP will need to provide additional margin. However, in arrangements in which CCPs have agreed, consistent with their regulatory framework, to contribute to each other’s default funds, the linked CCPs should assess and mitigate the risks of making such contributions via specific conditions. In particular, funds used by a CCP to contribute to another CCP&#39;s default fund must represent prefunded additional financial resources and must not include resources used by the CCP to satisfy its regulatory requirements to hold sufficient capital or participant margin funds (or any other funds, including independent default fund resources) held by the CCP to mitigate the counterparty risk presented by its participants. The contributing CCP should further ensure that any consequent exposure of its own participants to the risk of a participant default in the linked CCP is fully transparent to and understood by its participants. The contributing CCPs may, for example, consider it appropriate to ensure the default fund contribution is made only by those of its participants that use the link, if applicable. Moreover, the resources provided by one CCP to another should be held in such a way that they are ring fenced from other resources provided to that CCP. For example, securities could be held in a separate account at a custodian. Cash would need to be held in segregated accounts to be considered as acceptable collateral in this case.</a>160<span class="p"> Finally, in case of a participant default in the first CCP, the use of the linked CCP’s contribution to the default fund of the first CCP could be restricted or limited. For example, the linked CCP’s contribution to the default fund could be put at the bottom of the first CCP’s default waterfall.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3.20.18."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Link arrangements between CCPs will expose each CCP to sharing in potentially uncovered credit losses if the linked CCP’s default waterfall has been exhausted. For example, a CCP may be exposed to loss mutualisation from defaults of a linked CCP’s participants. This risk will be greater to the extent that the first CCP is unable directly to monitor or control the other CCP’s participants. Such contagion risks can be even more serious in cases where more than two CCPs are linked, directly or indirectly, and a CCP considering such a link should satisfy itself that it can manage such risks adequately. Each CCP should ensure that the consequent exposure of its own participants to a share in these uncovered losses is fully understood and disclosed to its participants.

A TR can establish links with another TR or with another type of FMI. Such links may expose the linked FMIs to additional risks if not properly designed. Besides legal risks, a link to either another TR or to another type of FMI may involve the potential spillover of operational risk. The mitigation of operational risk is particularly important because the information maintained by a TR can support bilateral netting and be used to provide services directly to market participants, service providers (for example, portfolio compression service providers), and other linked FMIs. FMIs establishing a link to a TR should ensure that the system and communication arrangements between the linked entities are reliable and secure such that the operation of the link does not pose significant reliability and security risks. Moreover, given the role that a TR may play at the beginning of the clearing and settlement process for derivatives transactions, a TR should have governance arrangements that ensure the management of the linked entities would not inhibit the smooth functioning of the link, related risk- management arrangements, and non-discriminatory access to the link. Therefore, the scalability of IT and related resources may be especially important.</p></li></ol></ol></ol><div class="textbox" style="border:0.5pt solid #000000;display:block;min-height:27.4pt;width:469.1pt;"><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark265">&zwnj;</a>Efficiency<a name="bookmark459">&zwnj;</a></p></div><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Efficiency and safety are important to an FMI in performing its payment, clearing, settlement, and recording functions.

An FMI also should consider and control its indirect costs. These include infrastructure, administrative, and other types of costs associated with operating the FMI. Some indirect costs (and risks) may be less apparent. For example, an FMI may need to consider its participants’ liquidity costs, which include the amount of cash or other financial instruments that a participant must provide to the FMI, or other parties, in order to process its transactions, and the opportunity cost of providing such assets. An FMI’s design has a significant impact on the liquidity costs borne by participants, which, in turn, affect the FMI’s costs and risks.

FMIs should ensure, however, that they adhere to appropriate standards of safety and security as outlined in the principles in this report. Both private and central bank operators of FMIs should make use of market disciplines, as appropriate, to promote efficiency in the FMI’s operations. For example, an FMI could use competitive tendering to select service providers.

A TR should promptly record the transaction information it receives from its participants. To ensure the accuracy and timeliness of data, a TR should employ efficient recordkeeping procedures to document changes to recorded transaction information resulting from subsequent post-trade events. Ideally, a TR should set a service-level target to record to its central registry transaction information it receives from participants in real time, and at a minimum, within one business day. A TR should have adequate procedures and timelines for making data available for any downstream processing and should implement quality controls to ensure the accuracy, validity, and integrity of the data it stores and disseminates.

An FMI’s adoption of internationally accepted communication procedures and standards for its core functions can facilitate the elimination of manual intervention in clearing and settlement processing, reduce risks and transaction costs, improve efficiency, and reduce barriers to entry into a market. Therefore, an FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate, relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and standards to ensure effective communication between the FMI and its participants, their customers, and others that connect to the FMI.

Standardised communication procedures (or protocols) provide a common set of rules across systems for exchanging messages. These rules allow for a broad set of systems and institutions in various locations to communicate efficiently and effectively.

Furthermore, adopting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">these communication procedures can facilitate interoperability between the information systems or operating platforms of FMIs in different jurisdictions, which allows market participants to obtain access to multiple FMIs without facing technical hurdles (such as having to implement or support multiple local networks with different characteristics). An FMI that operates across borders also should be able to support and use well-established communication procedures, messaging standards, and reference data standards relating to counterparty identification and securities numbering processes. For example, relevant standards promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization should be carefully considered and adopted by an FMI. If an FMI that operates across borders does not fully adopt international procedures and standards, it can still potentially interoperate with the information systems or operating platforms of other FMIs by developing systems to translate or convert international procedures and standards into the domestic equivalent, and vice versa.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark277">&zwnj;</a>Use of internationally accepted procedures and standards by TRs</p></li><li data-list-text="3.22.5."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark466" class="a">Communication procedures and standards are particularly important for TRs that serve as a central data source for a variety of stakeholders potentially located in many jurisdictions.

These disclosures collectively help participants evaluate the total cost of using a particular service, compare these costs to those of alternative arrangements, and select only the services that they wish to use. For example, large-value payment systems typically have higher values and lower volumes than retail payment systems, and, as a result, processing costs can be less important to participants than the costs of providing liquidity to fund payments throughout the day.

FMIs provide a number of services that are vital to a well-functioning financial system, including facilitating the exchange of money for goods, services, and financial assets and providing a safe and efficient means through which authorities can manage systemic risk and central banks can implement monetary policy. By design, FMIs concentrate payment, clearing, and settlement activities and trade data in order to manage risk better and to reduce payment, clearing, settlement, and recording costs and delays. Well-functioning FMIs can vastly improve the efficiency, transparency, and safety of financial systems. However, FMIs often concentrate risk and may even act as a source of systemic risk.

The precise framework for making such decisions may vary across jurisdictions. In some countries, for example, there is a statutory framework, while in others, the central bank or other relevant authorities have greater discretion to set the criteria used. A basic criterion, however, is the function of the FMI. Systemically important payment systems, CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs are typically subject to regulation, supervision, and oversight because of the critical role that they play in the financial system. Criteria that are often considered in determining the need for or degree of regulation, supervision, and oversight for various types of FMIs include</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) the number and value of transactions processed, (b) the number and type of participants,</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(c) the markets served, (d) the market share controlled, (e) the interconnectedness with other FMIs and other financial institutions, and (f) the available alternatives to using the FMI at short notice.

These functions may include gathering information on FMIs, assessing the operation and design of FMIs, assessing interdependencies among FMIs, taking action to promote FMIs’ observance of relevant policies and standards, and conducting on-site visits or inspections when necessary.

Some authorities may also have additional relevant public policy objectives for the FMIs they regulate, supervise, or oversee. These objectives are usually implemented through specific regulations and other policies, such as risk-management standards or expectations for FMIs. The policies of authorities should be consistent with their legislative framework.

The views of other authorities put forward through consultations should be considered, as appropriate, in connection with regulatory actions taken with respect to the FMI, including when the FMI is in a recovery, wind-down, or resolution scenario.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark505">&zwnj;</a>Timely access to trade data</p></li><li data-list-text="4.5.11."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Authorities primarily responsible for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of a TR that maintains data pertaining to other jurisdictions should coordinate with other relevant authorities to ensure timely and effective access to trade data and establish an appropriate data access process that is fair and consistent with the responsibilities of the other relevant authorities, to the extent legally permissible. All relevant authorities should mutually support each other’s access to trade data in which they have a material interest in furtherance of their regulatory,  supervisory,  and  oversight  responsibilities,  regardless  of  the  particular organizational form or geographic location of a TR.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark506">&zwnj;</a>No pre-emption of statutory authority</p></li><li data-list-text="4.5.12."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each authority maintains its discretion to discourage the use of an FMI located in another jurisdiction or the provision of services to such an FMI if, in the authority’s judgment, the FMI is not prudently designed or managed or the principles are not adequately observed.

An example of such a circumstance would be if the authority concerned had been unable to secure changes to the FMI’s risk controls which it regarded as necessary given the FMI’s systemic importance in its jurisdiction. An authority exercising such discretion should provide a clear rationale for the action taken both to the FMI and to the authority or authorities with direct responsibility for the supervision or oversight of the FMI.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.5.13."><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cooperative arrangements between authorities in no way prejudice the statutory or legal or other powers of each participating authority, nor do these arrangements constrain in any way an authority’s powers to fulfil its statutory or legislative mandate or its discretion to act in accordance with those powers.

Where confirmation of trades by indirect market participants (such as institutional investors) is required, it should occur as soon as possible after trade execution, preferably on T+0, but no later than T+1.</p><ol id="l131"><ol id="l132"><li data-list-text="3.10"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first step in settling a securities trade is to ensure that the buyer and the seller agree on the terms of the transaction, a process referred to as trade confirmation. Often a broker-dealer or member of an exchange (a direct market participant) acts as an intermediary in executing trades on behalf of others (indirect market participants). In such circumstances, trade confirmation often occurs on two separate tracks: confirmation of the terms of the trade between direct participants and confirmation (sometimes termed “affirmation”) of the intended terms between each direct participant and the indirect participant for whom the direct participant is acting. (Generally, indirect market participants for whom confirmations are required include institutional investors and cross-border clients.) On both tracks, agreement of trade details should occur as soon as possible so that errors and discrepancies can be discovered early in the settlement process. Early detection should help to avoid errors in recording trades, which could result in inaccurate books and records, increased and mismanaged market risk and credit risk, and increased costs. While this process is occurring, the back offices of the direct market participants, indirect market participants and custodians that act as agents for the indirect market participants need to prepare settlement instructions, which should be matched prior to the settlement date. Speedy, accurate verification of trades and matching settlement instructions is an essential precondition for avoiding settlement failures, especially when the settlement cycle is relatively short. (See Recommendation 3 regarding the length of settlement cycles.)</p></li><li data-list-text="3.11"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Trade confirmation systems are increasingly becoming automated. Many markets already have in place systems for the automatic comparison of trades between direct market participants. (In many markets, the use of electronic trading systems obviates the need for direct market participants to match the terms of the trade.) Automated matching systems are also being proposed and implemented for trade confirmation between direct market participants and indirect market participants and for the matching of settlement instructions. Automation improves processing times by eliminating the requirement to send information back and forth manually between parties and by avoiding the errors inherent in manual processing.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.12"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At its most sophisticated, automation allows manual intervention to be eliminated from post-trade processing through the implementation of straight through processing (STP), that is, procedures that require trade data to be entered only once and then use those same data for all post-trade requirements related to settlement. Many practitioners believe that market-wide achievement of STP is essential, both for maintaining high settlement rates as volumes increase and for ensuring timely settlement of cross-border trades, particularly if reductions in settlement cycles are to be achieved. STP systems may use a common message format or use a translation facility that either converts different message formats into a common format or translates between different formats. Several initiatives aim to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">achieve STP. These initiatives should be encouraged, and direct and indirect market participants should achieve the degree of internal automation necessary to take full advantage of whatever solutions emerge.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recommendation 3: Settlement cycles</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rolling settlement should be adopted in all securities markets. Final settlement should occur no later than T+3. The benefits and costs of a settlement cycle shorter than T+3 should be evaluated.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.13"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under a rolling settlement cycle, trades settle a given number of days after the trade date rather than at the end of an “account period”, thereby limiting the number of outstanding trades and reducing aggregate market exposure. The longer the period from trade execution to settlement, the greater the risk that one of the parties may become insolvent or default on the trade, the larger the number of unsettled trades, and the greater the opportunity for the prices of the securities to move away from the contract prices, thereby increasing the risk that non-defaulting parties will incur a loss when replacing the unsettled contracts. In 1989, the G30 recommended that final settlement of cash transactions should occur on T+3, that is, three business days after the trade date. However, the G30 recognised that “to minimise counterparty risk and market exposure associated with securities transactions; same day settlement is the final goal”.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.14"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This recommendation retains T+3 settlement as a minimum standard. Markets that have not yet achieved a T+3 settlement cycle should identify impediments to achieving T+3 and actively pursue the removal of those impediments. Many markets already are settling at a shorter interval than T+3. For example, many government securities already settle on T+1 or even T+0, and some equity markets are currently considering a T+1 settlement cycle. The standard judged appropriate for a type of security or market will depend upon factors such as transaction volume, price volatility and the extent of cross-border trading in the instrument. Each securities market should evaluate whether a cycle shorter than T+3 is appropriate, given the risk reduction benefits that could be achieved, the costs that would be incurred and the availability of alternative means of limiting pre-settlement risk, such as trade netting through a CCP (see Recommendation 4 below). Depending on these factors, some markets may conclude that different types of securities should have different settlement cycles.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.15"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Reducing the cycle is neither costless nor without certain risks. This is especially true for markets with significant cross-border activity because differences in time zones and national holidays, and the frequent involvement of multiple intermediaries, make timely trade confirmation more difficult. In most markets, a move to T+1 (perhaps even to T+2) would require a substantial reconfiguration of the trade settlement process and an upgrade of existing systems. For markets with a significant share of cross-border trades, substantial system improvements may be essential for shortening settlement cycles. Without such investments, a move to a shorter cycle could generate increased settlement fails, with a higher proportion of participants unable to agree and exchange settlement data or to acquire the necessary resources for settlement in the time available. Consequently, replacement cost risk would not be reduced as much as anticipated and operational risk and liquidity risk could increase.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.16"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regardless of the settlement cycle, the frequency and duration of settlement failures should be monitored closely. In some markets, the benefits of T+3 settlement are not being fully realised because the rate of settlement on the contractual date falls significantly short of 100%. In such circumstances, the risk implications of the fail rates should be analysed and actions identified that could reduce the rates or mitigate the associated risks. For example, monetary penalties for failing to settle could be imposed contractually or by market authorities; alternatively, failed trades could be marked to market and, if not resolved within a specified timeframe, closed out at market prices.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recommendation 4: Central counterparties (CCPs)</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The benefits and costs of a CCP should be evaluated. Where such a mechanism is introduced, the CCP should rigorously control the risks it assumes.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.17"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A central counterparty (CCP) interposes itself between trade counterparties, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. Thus, from the point of view of market participants the credit risk of the CCP is substituted for the credit risk of the other participants. (In some markets many of the benefits of a CCP are achieved by establishing an entity that indemnifies market participants against losses from counterparty defaults without actually acting as CCP.) If a CCP manages its risks effectively, its probability of default may be less than that of all or most of the market participants. Moreover, a CCP often bilaterally nets its obligations vis-à-vis its participants, which achieves multilateral netting of each participant’s obligations vis-à-vis all of the other participants. This can reduce substantially the potential losses in the event of the default of a participant, both on trades that have not reached settlement (replacement cost exposures) and on trades in the process of settlement (principal exposures). In addition, netting reduces the number and value of deliveries and payments needed to settle a given set of trades, thereby reducing liquidity risks and transaction costs.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.18"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Introduction of a CCP is another tool, in addition to shortening settlement cycles, for reducing counterparty credit risks. It is especially effective for reducing risks vis-à-vis active market participants, who often buy and sell the same security for settlement on the same date. In addition to these risk reduction benefits, the growing demand for CCP arrangements in part reflects the increasing use of anonymous electronic trading systems, where orders are matched according to the rules of the system and participants cannot always manage their credit risks bilaterally through their choice of counterparty.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.19"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, a CCP will not be appropriate in all markets. Establishing a CCP is not without costs. In particular, establishing the kind of robust risk-management system that a CCP must have (see discussion below) generally requires significant initial investments and ongoing expenses. Thus, individual markets should assess carefully the balance of the benefits and costs of a CCP. This balance will depend on factors such as the volume and value of transactions, trading patterns among counterparties, and the opportunity costs associated with settlement liquidity. A growing number of markets have determined that the benefits of implementing a CCP outweigh the costs.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.20"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a CCP is established, it is important that it have sound risk management because the CCP assumes responsibility for risk management and reallocates risk among its participants through its policies and procedures. As a result, if a CCP does not perform risk management well, the CCP could increase risk to market participants. The ability of the system as a whole to withstand the default of individual participants depends crucially on the risk-management procedures of the CCP and its access to resources to absorb financial losses. The failure of a CCP would almost certainly have serious systemic consequences, especially where multiple markets are served by one CCP. Consequently, a CCP’s ability to monitor and control the credit, liquidity, legal and operational risks it incurs and to absorb losses is essential to the sound functioning of the markets it serves. A CCP must be able to withstand severe shocks, including defaults by one or more of its participants, and its financial support arrangements should be evaluated in this context. Furthermore, there must be a sound and transparent legal basis for the netting arrangements, whether by novation or otherwise. For example, netting must be enforceable against the participants in bankruptcy. Without such legal underpinnings, net obligations may be challenged in judicial or administrative insolvency proceedings. If these challenges are successful, the CCP or the original counterparty may face additional settlement exposure. The CCP must also be operationally sound and must ensure that its participants have the incentive and the ability to manage the risks they assume.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.21"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CCPs adopt a variety of means to control risk. The precise means reflects the market served and the nature of the risks incurred. Access criteria are essential (see [Principle 18, formerly] Recommendation 14 on access). The CCP’s exposures should be collateralised. Most CCPs require members to deposit collateral to cover potential market movements on open positions or unsettled transactions. Positions are also generally marked to market one or more times daily, with the CCP taking additional cash or collateral to cover any changes in the net value of the open positions of participants since the previous valuation and settlement. During volatile periods, CCPs may collect additional collateral to minimise further their exposure. CCPs should also have rules specifying clearly how defaults will be handled and how losses will be shared in the event that a defaulting firm’s collateral fails to cover its exposure. For example, CCPs may require their members to contribute to default clearing funds, typically composed of cash or high-quality, liquid securities and calculated using a formula based on the volume of the participant’s settlement activity. Those funds are often augmented through insurance or other financial support. Liquidity demands are usually met by some combination of clearing fund assets and firmly committed bank credit lines. Rules and procedures for handling defaults should be transparent to enable members and other market participants to assess the risks they assume because of their membership in and use of a CCP.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.22"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark530" class="a">CCPs are currently developing global risk-management standards that draw on their common experience and expertise. In February 2001, senior executives of the European Association of Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (EACH) developed risk-management standards for their organisations.

For example, borrowing to support short sales is illegal in some circumstances in some markets. Even in jurisdictions that restrict securities lending because of other public policy concerns, authorities should consider permitting lending to reduce settlement failures. Impediments to the development and functioning of securities lending markets should, as far as possible, be removed. In many markets, the processing of securities lending transactions involves manually intensive procedures. In the absence of robust and automated procedures, errors and operational risks increase, and it may be difficult to achieve timely settlement of securities lending transactions, which often need to settle on a shorter cycle than regular trades. The scope for improvement in the processing of cross-border borrowing and lending transactions is particularly large. Some CSDs seek to overcome these impediments by providing centralised lending facilities; others offer services intended to support the bilateral lending market. The needs of individual markets will differ, and market participants and CSDs should evaluate the usefulness of the different types of facilities.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.25"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other impediments might arise from tax or accounting policies, from legal restrictions on lending, from an inadequate legal underpinning for securities lending or from ambiguities about the treatment of such transactions in a bankruptcy. One of the most significant barriers to development may be related to taxation of securities lending transactions. A tax authority’s granting of tax neutrality to the underlying transaction and the elimination of certain transaction taxes have served to increase activity in several jurisdictions. Accounting standards also have an influence on the securities lending market, particularly with respect to whether, and under what conditions, collateral must be reflected on the balance sheet. Authorities in some jurisdictions restrict the types or amounts of securities that may be loaned, the types of counterparties that may lend securities, or the permissible types of collateral. Uncertainty about the legal status of transactions, for example their treatment in insolvency situations, also inhibits development of a securities lending market. The legal and regulatory structure must be clear so that all parties involved understand their rights and obligations.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.26"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While securities lending may be a useful tool, it presents risk to both the borrower and the lender. The securities lent or the collateral may not be returned when needed, because of counterparty default, operational failure or legal challenge, for example. Those securities would then need to be acquired in the market, perhaps at a cost. Counterparties to securities loans should employ appropriate risk-management policies, including conducting credit evaluations, collateralising exposures, marking exposures and collateral to market daily, and employing master legal agreements.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recommendation 6: Central securities depositories (CSDs)</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Securities should be immobilised or dematerialised and transferred by book entry in CSDs to the greatest extent possible.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.27"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are several different ways for beneficial owners to hold securities. In some jurisdictions, physical securities circulate and beneficial owners may keep securities in their possession, although beneficial owners typically employ a custodian to hold them to reduce risks and safekeeping costs. The costs and risks associated with owning and trading securities may be reduced considerably through immobilisation of physical securities, which involves concentrating the location of physical securities in a depository (or CSD). To promote immobilisation of all certificates of a particular issue, a jurisdiction could encourage the issuance of a global note, which represents the whole issue. A further step away from circulating physical securities is full dematerialisation of a securities issue. In this approach,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">there is no global note issued, as the rights and obligations stem from book entries in an electronic register.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.28"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to differences in physical arrangements for holding securities, there are important differences in the legal arrangements. Holding systems may be categorised generally as direct or indirect (see [Annex D, formerly] Annex 2 [of the RSSS]). Each type of system has advantages and disadvantages and either type of system can be designed in a manner that complies with these Recommendations. In jurisdictions that operate a direct holding system but in which the CSD is not the official registrar of the issuer, a transfer of securities in the CSD should result automatically in the transfer of legal title to the securities in the official register of the issuer.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.29"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The immobilisation or dematerialisation of securities and their transfer by book entry within a CSD significantly reduces the total costs associated with securities settlements and custody. By centralising the operations associated with custody and transfer within a single entity, costs can be reduced through economies of scale. In addition, efficiency gains can be achieved through increased automation, which reduces the errors and delays inherent in manual processing. By reducing costs and improving the speed and efficiency of settlement, book entry settlement also supports the development of securities lending markets, including markets for repurchase agreements and other economically equivalent transactions. These activities, in turn, enhance the liquidity of securities markets and facilitate the use of securities collateral to manage counterparty risks, thereby increasing the efficiency of trading and settlement. Effective governance (see [Principle 2, formerly] Recommendation 13) is necessary, however, to ensure that these benefits are not lost as a result of monopolistic behaviour by the CSD.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.30"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The immobilisation or dematerialisation of securities also reduces or eliminates certain risks, for example destruction or theft of certificates. The transfer of securities by book entry is a precondition for the shortening of the settlement cycle for securities trades, which reduces replacement cost risks. Book entry transfer also facilitates delivery versus payment, thereby eliminating principal risks.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.31"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, for both safety and efficiency reasons, securities should be immobilised or dematerialised in CSDs to the greatest extent possible. In practice, retail investors may not be prepared to give up their certificates. However, it is not necessary to achieve complete immobilisation to realise the benefits of CSDs. It may be sufficient that the most active market participants immobilise their holdings. Less active investors that insist on holding certificates should bear the costs of their decisions.</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recommendation 12: Protection of customers’ securities</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Entities holding securities in custody should employ accounting practices and safekeeping procedures that fully protect customers’ securities.

Because customer securities must also be protected against the claims of a custodian’s creditors, a customer’s claims against a custodian are typically given priority or are given preferential treatment under insolvency law. (Nonetheless, customer assets could be subject to liens in favour of the custodian if, for example, the customer has pledged them to secure an obligation to the custodian.) One way that a customer can be protected in the event of a custodian’s insolvency is through segregation (identification) of customer securities on the books of the custodian (and of all subcustodians, and ultimately, the CSD). Even when customer securities are segregated from a custodian’s own securities, customers may still be at risk of a loss if the custodian does not hold sufficient securities to satisfy all customer claims or if an individual customer’s securities cannot be readily identified. Thus, entities that hold securities in custody (or maintain records of balances of securities) should reconcile their records regularly to keep them current and accurate. Other ways to safeguard or protect customers against misappropriation and theft include internal controls and insurance or other compensation schemes.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.62"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ideally, a customer’s securities are immune from claims made by third-party creditors of the custodian. Although the ideal is not realised in all circumstances, when the entities through which securities are held are performing their responsibilities effectively, the likelihood of a successful legal claim made on a customer’s securities by a third-party creditor is minimised. In addition, in the event of a custodian’s or subcustodian’s insolvency, it should be highly improbable that a customer’s securities could be frozen or made unavailable for an extended period of time. If that were to happen, the customer could come under liquidity pressures, suffer price losses or fail to meet its obligations. Segregation is a common device that facilitates the movement of a customer’s positions by a receiver to a solvent custodian, thereby enabling customers to manage their positions and meet their settlement obligations. To bring these results about, it is essential that the legal framework support segregation of customer assets or other arrangements for prioritising claims in bankruptcy that serve to protect customers’ holdings. It is also important for supervisory authorities to enforce effective segregation of customer assets by custodians.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.63"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cross-border holdings of securities often involve several layers of intermediaries acting as custodians. For example, an institutional investor may hold its securities through a global custodian, which, in turn, holds securities in a subcustodian that is a member of the local CSD. Or a broker-dealer may hold its securities through its home country CSD or an international CSD, which, in turn, holds its securities through a cross-border link with the local CSD or through a local custodian. Mechanisms to protect customer assets may vary depending on the type of securities holding system instituted in a jurisdiction. Beneficial owners of securities should understand the extent of a custodian’s responsibility for securities held through intermediate custodians.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.64"><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To prevent unexpected losses, a global custodian should determine whether the legal framework in the jurisdiction of each of its local subcustodians has appropriate mechanisms to protect customer assets. Alternatively, a global custodian should keep its customers apprised of the custody risk arising from holding securities in a particular jurisdiction. Global custodians should also ascertain whether their local subcustodians employ appropriate accounting, safekeeping and segregation procedures for customer securities. Likewise, when home country CSDs and ICSDs establish links to other CSDs, they should ensure that those other CSDs protect customer securities adequately. With complex cross-border arrangements, it is imperative that sound practices and procedures be used by all entities in the chain of custodians so that the interests of beneficial owners are protected from legal actions relating to the insolvency of, or the commission of fraud by, any one of the custodians. Each jurisdiction should take the attributes of its securities holding system into account in judging whether its legal framework includes appropriate mechanisms to protect a custodian’s customer against loss upon the insolvency of, or the commission of fraud by, a custodian.</p></li></ol></ol><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark533">&zwnj;</a>Annex D:<a name="bookmark534">&zwnj;</a></h1><h1 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Summary of designs of payment systems, SSSs, and CCPs</h1><p style="padding-top: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">This annex provides a high-level description of various institutional designs associated with payment systems, securities settlement systems (SSSs), and central counterparties (CCPs).</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Payment systems</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark535" class="a">A payment system is a set of instruments, procedures, and rules for the transfer of funds between or among participants; the system includes the participants and the entity operating the arrangement.

A system may include a central entity that acts as the payment system operator (that is, it runs the infrastructure that processes  payment  obligations,  settlement  obligations,  or  both;  communicates  with participants; and, in some cases, calculates net obligations), as a settlement institution (that is, it debits and credits the balances in settlement accounts on its books), or as both. Further, the settlement institution may act as a type of central counterparty to each payment obligation (henceforth, payment), provide a guarantee of finality or settlement for each payment accepted to the system, or offer no form of settlement guarantee and let any associated risks remain with the participants. Other possible arrangements include an operating entity that is different from the settlement institution and operates some or all of the technical elements of the payment system on behalf of the participants or the settlement institution. In some cases, the operator will operate the system on behalf of a broader industry group, statutory body, or other organization as part of a payment scheme.</a>188<span class="p"> Still other arrangements may involve multilateral clearing and settlement systems with very limited roles for central entities.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Institutional designs</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Payment systems can be categorised generally into real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, deferred (or designated-time) net settlement (DNS) systems, and “hybrid” systems. The key distinctions among these three systems involve the form and timing of settlement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark535">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">187</span> See also, CPSS, <i>New developments in large-value payment systems</i>, May 2005</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark536">&zwnj;</a>188<span class="s10"> Some countries may have payment schemes for one or more types of payments in which there exists a rule- making body that sets rules or provides some form of governance applicable to the operator, the participants, or a broader set of parties.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Real-time gross settlement systems</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark537" class="a">RTGS systems settle payments continuously in real time (that is, without deferral) and on a gross basis, typically on a payment-by-payment basis. A payment is accepted by the system once it successfully passes the system’s validity and conditionality checks (such as that the sender has sufficient funds or credit available to send the payment) and is typically unconditional and irrevocable.</a>189<span class="p"> If the payment cannot be validated, it is generally rejected back to the sender. If the payment is validated but does not pass the conditionality checks, the payment is either queued or rejected back to the sender (although other alternatives may exist in some systems). RTGS systems provide the advantage that payments are settled with finality on a payment-by-payment basis in the course of the day, thus reducing intraday credit and liquidity exposures between participants. A downside of RTGS systems is that they require participants to have sufficient liquidity to cover the principal amount of each payment and can therefore require large amounts of intraday liquidity from participants.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Deferred net settlement systems</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In DNS systems, payments are accumulated and netted throughout the day (or possibly once per day), and settlement of the net amount takes place at the end of the day, if not more frequently intraday. By netting payment values among participants, DNS systems require significantly less liquidity for settlement, as compared to RTGS systems. However, DNS systems may expose participants to credit and liquidity risks for the period during which settlement is deferred. Settlement finality is only achieved at the end of the day (or at designated times during the day) in DNS systems and thus if there is no settlement guarantee, either by the system or its participants, there is no certainty that the payments will be settled until that point in time. If a participant fails to meet its payment obligation when due, some or all processed payments could be unwound, thereby exposing participants to liquidity risk and possibly credit risk depending on the design, rules, and legal framework of the payment system.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hybrid systems and liquidity-saving mechanisms</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In recent years, distinctions between RTGS and DNS systems have become less clear. Some DNS systems have increased the frequency of intraday final settlement to reduce risks associated with delayed settlement. Many RTGS systems have incorporated liquidity-saving features akin to netting in DNS systems in order to economise on participants’ use of liquidity. A range of system designs with liquidity-saving mechanisms and settlement priority options are sometimes classified as hybrid systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In general, liquidity-saving mechanisms include frequent netting or offsetting of payments during the course of the operating day. A typical approach is to hold payments in a central queue and to net or offset those payments on a bilateral or multilateral basis at frequent intervals. To the extent that resulting potential net debit positions are fully covered, the payments can be settled immediately. Liquidity-saving mechanisms reduce the amount of liquidity needed relative to traditional RTGS systems by using the potential liquidity from a participant’s incoming payments to settle outgoing payments via netting or offsetting. Liquidity-saving mechanisms also reduce settlement risk relative to DNS systems by providing intraday final settlement after each round of netting. However, systems with these mechanisms may require more liquidity than pure DNS systems, which typically conduct settlement once per day, and may involve greater settlement delays for some payments than pure RTGS systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark537">&zwnj;</a>189<span class="s10"> Some systems may have a legal or technical sequence of events that differs from this description yet achieves the same purposes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other payment system enhancements include the integration of recurrent netting or offsetting with real-time settlement functionality and the addition of prioritisation options for payment processing or settlement. Such functionality allows a participant either to settle a particular payment in real time (or near real time) or to place the payment in a queue for deferred settlement. In many cases, systems have adopted complex algorithms for settling payments. For example, some systems first attempt to settle a payment on a gross basis. If gross settlement is not possible (for example, due to insufficient funds or lack of available credit), the system attempts to bilaterally or multilaterally offset the payment against other pending payments, thereby reducing or eliminating the amount of liquidity required to settle the payment. A number of different optimisation routines can be used to match, offset, or net queued payments, and the complexity of these algorithms varies greatly. Some systems also allow participants to set settlement or processing priorities among different payments or payment types.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Payment process</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark538" class="a">Regardless of their design, payment systems typically have four conceptual stages of processing: submission, validation, conditionality, and settlement (see also Box 3).</a><a href="#bookmark538" class="s8">190</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Submission</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The first stage of the payment process is the submission of a payment to the payment system. A payment can take on a number of forms based on the type of payment being submitted (for example, time-critical versus non time-critical payments; balances of ancillary systems or cash legs of securities transactions for LVPS; or ACH, debit or credit transfers for retail payment systems). Payments may differ based on the direction of funds flows (for example, credit transfers or debit transfers), format, legal status, and medium (for example, in electronic form or physical form). Also, some payments may be submitted as individual payments or as part of a file of payments.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Validation</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once a payment is submitted, it must pass through the payment system’s validation procedures before it can be accepted for final settlement. The type of validation the payment system performs depends on its specific design, but typically includes verifying that the payment instruction includes certain key data elements. These validation procedures may also include security measures in addition to those employed by the network provider to verify the identity of the sender of the payment as well as to ensure the integrity and non- repudiation of the payment itself. In the event that the payment system cannot validate a payment, it is usually returned to the sending participant and is not considered eligible for settlement. If the validation is successful, the payment system subjects the payment to conditionality requirements.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conditionality</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark539" class="a">Another key feature of a payment system’s design is the set of conditions that a payment must meet in order for it to be accepted by the system and be settled. In the most straightforward case, after the payment has been validated, the only condition for settlement is whether the sender has sufficient funds available (or access to intraday credit).</a>191<span class="p"> If the</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark538">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">190</span> See also CPSS, <i>New developments in large-value payment systems</i>, May 2005.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark539">&zwnj;</a>191<span class="s10"> Additional conditions for settlement may be created by limits set either by a participant or by the system. While limits typically restrict credit exposures, a recent feature in some systems providing continuous intraday finality is the introduction of position or sender limits in order to control the outflow of settlement funds.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">payment exceeds the amount of funds available, the payment system may reject the payment. Alternatively, the system may temporarily place the payment in a system queue. The queued payment will be released from the queue at a later stage when all relevant conditions for settlement are satisfied. Even in systems without a queue, other options beside rejection may be possible. For example, in the case that a payment cannot be settled under a sender’s limit, it is possible that the payment may still be settled subject to the sender undergoing a programme of ex-post counselling.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Settlement</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A payment is final at the point in time when it becomes irrevocable and unconditional. This precise moment typically depends on the underlying legal regime and the rules of the payment system itself. In some systems, a payment becomes irrevocable as soon as the system validates it (that is, queued payment orders cannot be revoked by the sender). However, the payment may not provide funds irrevocably and unconditionally to the receiver or the beneficiary until settlement occurs and is final. In other systems, payments remain revocable until settlement takes place and, lastly, in some systems a payment can only be revoked with the receiver’s consent. In general, however, in an RTGS system, a payment becomes final after it is validated by the payment system and has passed the necessary conditionality checks.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a DNS system, a payment is typically considered final upon final settlement at the designated time(s). However, in DNS systems, it is possible for settlement of the net amount to be final, while individual payments are not finally settled or paid. Some DNS systems may also provide an explicit settlement guarantee, either from the operator of the system or from the participants as a group. Such systems would also have financial mechanisms to support such a guarantee.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:13.71pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:21pt"><td

These mechanisms may involve either the simultaneous settlement of securities and funds or the sequential settlement of securities and funds. In addition, settlement may occur on an obligation-by-obligation (that is, gross) or on a net basis. There are three common models for achieving DvP.</a>194<span class="p"> The first, DvP model 1, is a system that settles transfers for both securities and funds on a gross basis, with final (irrevocable and unconditional) transfer of securities from the seller to the buyer (delivery) occurring at the same time as final transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller (payment). The second, DvP model 2, is a system that settles securities transfer obligations on a gross basis, with final transfer of securities from the seller to the buyer occurring throughout the processing cycle, but settles funds transfer obligations on a net basis, with final transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller occurring at the end of the processing cycle. Lastly, the third, DvP model 3, is a system that settles transfer obligations for both securities and funds on a net basis, with final transfers of both securities and funds occurring at the end of the processing cycle.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Model 1: Gross, simultaneous settlements of securities and funds transfers</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark543" class="a">The essential characteristic of a DvP model 1 system is the simultaneous settlement of individual securities transfers and associated funds transfers. The system typically maintains both securities and funds accounts for participants and makes all transfers by book entry.</a>195<a href="#bookmark544" class="a"> An “against payment” transfer is settled by debiting the seller’s securities account, crediting the buyer’s securities account, debiting the buyer’s funds account, and crediting the seller’s funds account.</a>196<span class="p"> All transfers are final at the instant the debits and credits are posted to the securities and funds accounts. Overdrafts (negative balances) on securities accounts are prohibited, but the settlement agent typically provides intraday credit on funds accounts to facilitate settlement, subject to the SSS’s operating rules and risk-management controls. An advantage of model 1 is that transactions become final on an obligation-by-obligation basis during the course of the settlement day, thus reducing credit and liquidity exposures among participants or between a participant and the SSS. A disadvantage of model 1, however, is that it requires participants to cover the principal value of the funds leg of each obligation, thus requiring a potentially large amount of liquidity from participants. To help mitigate this disadvantage, some systems have adopted mechanisms for both securities and funds similar to the liquidity-saving mechanisms used by payment systems.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark542">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">194</span> See CPSS, <i>Delivery versus payment in securities settlement systems</i>, September 1992.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark543">&zwnj;</a>195<span class="s10"> If funds accounts are held by another entity, a communications link must be established between the operator of the securities transfer system and the entity handling participants’ funds to provide the securities transfer system with real-time information on the completion of funds transfers.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark544">&zwnj;</a>196<span class="s10"> The system may also allow participants to make “free of payment”, that is, transfers of securities without a corresponding transfer of funds, or “free of transfers”, that is, transfers of funds without a corresponding transfer of securities.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Model 2: Gross settlements of securities transfers followed by net settlement of funds transfers</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The essential characteristic of a DvP model 2 system is that securities transfers are settled on a obligation-by-obligation (gross) basis throughout the processing cycle, while funds transfers are settled on a net basis, typically at the end of the processing cycle. The system maintains securities accounts for participants. Funds accounts may be maintained by a separate entity, such as a commercial bank or a central bank. Securities are transferred by book entry. These securities transfers are usually provisional until the corresponding funds settlement becomes final. The corresponding funds transfers are irrevocable but not final. During the processing cycle (or perhaps at the end of the settlement day) the system calculates net balances of funds debits and credits. The net balances are settled at the end of the processing cycle when the net debit positions and net credit positions are posted to the books of the commercial bank or central bank that maintains the funds accounts. Settlement of funds transfers may occur once a day or several times a day. Like model 1 systems, model 2 systems prohibit participants from overdrawing securities accounts but, in some cases, intraday credit is allowed for funds, subject to SSS or participant established limits or risk-management controls. A securities transfer may be rejected if there are insufficient securities available in the seller’s account or the seller fails any other risk-management test. By netting the funds values among participants, a model 2 system requires significantly less liquidity for settlement, as compared to a model 1 system. A disadvantage to model 2, however, is the amount of risk created by the delay in settlement finality, which is only achieved at the end of the settlement day (or at designated times during the day).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Model 3: Simultaneous net settlement of securities and funds transfers</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark545" class="a">The essential characteristic of a DvP model 3 system is the simultaneous net settlement of both securities and funds transfer obligations. Settlement may occur once a day or at several times during the day. The system maintains securities accounts for participants. Funds accounts may be maintained by the SSS or a separate entity, such as a commercial bank or a central bank. Securities are transferred by book entry. During a processing cycle (or at the end of the settlement day), net balances of debits and credits to securities and funds accounts are calculated. However, book-entry transfers of securities do not occur until the end of the processing cycle. In the interim, all securities and funds transfers are provisional. At the end of the processing cycle (and possibly also at points during the processing cycle) the system checks whether those participants in a net debit position in securities and funds have sufficient balances to cover their net debits.</a>197<span class="p"> If a participant has insufficient balances, it may be notified and given an opportunity to obtain the necessary securities or funds. Final transfers of the net securities balances and net funds balances are executed if and only if all participants with net debit positions have sufficient balances of securities and funds. A disadvantage to model 3, however, is the potentially large liquidity exposures created if a participant fails to settle its net funds debit position. In this scenario, some or all of the defaulting participant’s transfers may have to be unwound.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Settlement process</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The process of clearing and settling a securities trade includes three key steps: the confirmation of the settlement obligations; clearance (the calculation of the obligations of the counterparties resulting from the confirmation process); and settlement (the final transfer of securities in exchange for final transfer of funds in order to settle the obligations). An SSS, as</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark545">&zwnj;</a>197<span class="s10"> In some systems a transfer would not be processed if it would result in a net debit position in a security larger than the participant’s balance in that security. In other systems, however, an inadequate securities balance might not become evident until later in the processing cycle or at the end of the processing cycle.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">strictly defined in this report, is involved in the settlement step of the clearing and settlement process, but many SSSs may be organised to provide additional securities clearing and settlement services, such as trade confirmation, settlement obligation validation, and securities safekeeping and custody.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Confirmation of settlement obligations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once a trade is executed, the first step in the clearing and settlement process is to ensure that the counterparties to the trade (the buyer and the seller) agree on the terms, including the securities involved, the amounts to be exchanged, and the settlement date. This process of trade confirmation can take place in a variety of ways and the trading mechanism itself often determines how it occurs. For example, an electronic trading system may automatically produce a confirmed trade between the two counterparties. Other trades may be confirmed by exchanges, CCPs, or other organizations based on data submitted to them by the participants. In over-the-counter (OTC) markets, participants typically confirm the trade bilaterally.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clearance</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After trades have been confirmed, the next step in the process is clearance, which is the computation of the counterparties’ obligations to make deliveries or payments on the settlement date. Clearance typically occurs in one of two ways, either on a gross basis, in which systems compute obligations for every trade individually, or a net basis. In some markets, a CCP interposes itself between the counterparties to a securities trade, taking on each party’s obligation in relation to the other. A CCP typically reduces credit and liquidity risks for the trade counterparties by netting the underlying trade obligations. Netting arrangements are increasingly common in securities markets with high volumes of trades because properly designed netting algorithms produce significant reductions in gross exposures  in  such  markets.  Trade  or  obligation  netting  arrangements  should  be distinguished from settlement or payment netting arrangements, in which underlying obligations are not extinguished but funds or securities transfers are settled on a net basis.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Settlement</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Settlement of a trade involves the final transfer of the securities from the seller to the buyer (delivery) and the final transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller (payment). The processing of transfers by an SSS (and perhaps a payment system) often involves several stages before the transfers are final and the settlement process is complete. The obligation is discharged when the transfer becomes final, that is, an irrevocable and unconditional transfer.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Central counterparties</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A CCP interposes itself between counterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market  participants  through  novation,  open-offer,  or  an  analogous  legally  binding arrangement. A CCP has the potential to reduce its participants’ risks significantly by multilaterally netting trades and imposing more-effective risk controls on all participants. A CCP’s typical risk controls include requiring participants to provide collateral (usually in the form of margin) to cover current and potential future exposures, collecting and paying mark- to-market losses and gains frequently to reduce current exposure, and requiring participants to share residual risk in the event that one or more participant defaults. A CCP’s risk- reduction mechanisms can also reduce systemic risk in the markets it serves depending on the effectiveness of the CCP’s risk controls and the adequacy of its financial resources.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Organisational structures</h2><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark546" class="a">A CCP may be privately or publicly owned and operate on an at-cost or for-profit basis. A CCP may serve one or more markets where trades are conducted on an exchange, over-the- counter, or both and, potentially, operate across multiple jurisdictions. A CCP may be vertically or horizontally integrated.</a>198<a href="#bookmark547" class="a"> Vertical integration in clearing is characterised by the formation of an integrated group, typically bringing trade and post-trade infrastructure providers under common ownership with other parts of the value chain. Horizontal integration occurs when a CCP expands clearing to more than one type of product or the products traded at more than one trading venue.</a><a href="#bookmark547" class="s8">199</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Institutional designs</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Institutional designs vary from one CCP to another. These differences may reflect risk characteristics of the instruments that the CCP clears, the characteristics of the participants for which the CCP clears, other external factors, and the design of the CCP’s risk- management framework.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Factors affecting institutional design</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A number of factors affect the institutional design of a CCP, including its risk-management framework. Among these are the risk characteristics of the instruments that a CCP clears. For example, some instruments may be complex or have high market volatility, jump-to- default risk, or other hard-to-model sources of risk. Another important factor is the inherent liquidity of the market being served. A less liquid market will lead to, among other things, longer close-out times, increased difficulty in marking-to-market, and increased model risk. Other attributes affecting institutional design are the magnitude of the duration of the exposure between the CCP and its counterparties. Contracts cleared by a CCP can vary in length from as short as one day (such as in some securities markets) to upwards of several decades (such as in the credit-default swap market). Additionally, some contracts are characterised by trading practices that feature long periods between trade date and final settlement (such as in the futures market).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further, the design of a CCP may be influenced by the characteristics of the market participants for which the CCP clears. In some markets, a CCP may permit a diverse set of market participants to access its services. These participants can range from large banks to small non-bank dealers, and possibly buy-side firms. The range market participants may affect the CCP’s risk-management framework, including the amount of financial resources, eligible collateral, and loss-sharing arrangements. Further, the design of a CCP is further influenced by other external requirements, such as regulatory requirements, required levels of funding, and capital costs. A careful analysis of these, and the individual risk appetite of the CCP, will influence decisions towards one design over another. As such, legal and institutional arrangements will also influence the institutional design of a CCP. For example, the laws governing novation, open offer, and similar legal devices may vary by jurisdiction.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Form of guarantee</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An important element of any CCP design is the legal mechanism for the CCP to become the counterparty to its participants’ trades. In most cases, this is either novation or open offer. In novation, the original contract between the buyer and seller is discharged and two new</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark546">&zwnj;</a><span class="s9">198</span> See also CPSS, <i>Market structure developments in the clearing industry: implications for financial stability</i>, September 2010.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark547">&zwnj;</a>199<span class="s10"> It should be noted that, in some jurisdictions, a CCP may be classified as either vertically or horizontally integrated; the two are not mutually exclusive.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">contracts are created, one between the CCP and the buyer and the other between the CCP and the seller. The CCP thereby assumes the original parties’ contractual obligations to each other. In an open-offer system, a CCP extends an open offer to act as a counterparty to its participants and is automatically and immediately interposed in a transaction at the moment the buyer and seller agree on the terms, either at the exchange or at the point of agreement over-the-counter. In an open offer system, if all pre-agreed conditions are met, the buyer and seller never have a contractual relationship. In jurisdictions that support them, both novation and open offer give market participants legal certainty that a CCP is obligated to effect settlement. Other legal mechanisms that allow a CCP to guarantee obligations and perform netting also exist such as explicit and legally binding, settlement guarantees.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Approaches to loss allocation</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the event of a participant default, a CCP will need access to financial resources to perform on its obligations and may need to initiate its loss-allocation procedures. In developing its loss-allocation procedures, a CCP may combine a defaulter-pay approach and a survivor- pay approach.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Defaulter-pay approach. <span class="p">In employing a defaulter-pay approach, a CCP seeks to cover a large proportion of its losses with the defaulting participant’s financial resources. A CCP seeking to emphasize the use of the defaulter-pay approach would have higher levels of financial resources provided by the defaulter in the default waterfall, thereby making it less likely that losses will need to be allocated to non-defaulting participants through pooling-of- resources arrangements, such as a default fund. In these arrangements, the initial margin provided by non-defaulting participants cannot be used to cover losses. Defaulter-pay approaches typically decrease moral hazard because each participant is responsible for a significant proportion of its own potential losses. The use of defaulter-pay approach has historically been more prevalent in derivatives markets.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Survivor-pay approach. <span class="p">In employing a survivor-pay approach, a CCP would cover a residual portion of its losses with non-defaulting participants’ resources through a pooling-of- resources arrangement, such as a default fund. The pooling of resources effectively acts as an insurance arrangement supported by all of the participants. Non-defaulting participants of the CCP will typically bear the risk of losses not covered by the defaulter’s resources. There are a number of ways to allocate such losses among non-defaulting participants at different CCPs and in different jurisdictions. When applying this approach, the CCP should be attentive to the contagion risks created by interdependencies among participants.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark548">&zwnj;</a>Annex E:<a name="bookmark549">&zwnj;</a></h1><h1 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matrix of applicability of key considerations to specific types of FMIs</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:12.98pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:43pt"><td style="width:307pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Key considerations</p></td><td style="width:34pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PSs</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CSDs</p></td><td style="width:29pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SSSs</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CCPs</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TRs</p></td></tr><tr style="height:17pt"><td style="width:307pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principle 1: Legal basis</p></td><td style="width:34pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td><td style="width:29pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#E4E4E4"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td></tr><tr style="height:27pt"><td style="width:307pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">1.

A CCP should adopt initial margin models and parameters that are risk-based and generate margin requirements sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval between the last margin collection and the close out of positions following a participant default. Initial margin should meet an established single- tailed confidence level of at least 99 percent with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure. For a CCP that calculates margin at the portfolio level, this requirement applies to each portfolio’s distribution of future exposure. For a CCP that calculates margin at more-granular levels, such as at the subportfolio level or by product, the requirement must be met for the corresponding distributions of future exposure. The model should (a) use a conservative estimate of the time horizons for the effective hedging or close out of the particular types of products cleared by the CCP (including in stressed market conditions), (b) have an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products, and (c) to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the need for destabilising, procyclical changes.</p></td><td style="width:28pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">●</p></td></tr><tr style="height:58pt"><td style="width:307pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;padding-right: 8pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">4.

In calculating margin requirements, a CCP may allow offsets or reductions in required margin across products that it clears or between products that it and another CCP clear, if the risk of one product is significantly and reliably correlated with the risk of the other product.

A CCP should analyse and monitor its model performance and overall margin coverage by conducting rigorous daily backtesting and at least monthly, and more-frequent where appropriate, sensitivity analysis. A CCP should regularly conduct an assessment of the theoretical and empirical properties of its margin model for all products it clears. In conducting sensitivity analysis of the model’s coverage, a CCP should take into account a wide range of parameters and assumptions that reflect possible market conditions, including the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations between prices.</p></td><td

An FMI should determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of its liquid resources through rigorous stress testing.

In conducting stress testing, an FMI should consider a wide range of relevant scenarios. Scenarios should include relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions. Scenarios should also take into account the design and operation of the FMI, include all entities that might pose material liquidity risks to the FMI (such as settlement banks, nostro agents, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and linked FMIs), and where appropriate, cover a multiday period.

A regulator, supervisor, or overseer of an FMI may want to establish expectations for an FMI’s critical service providers in order to support the FMI’s overall safety and efficiency. The expectations should help ensure the operations of a critical service provider are held to the same standards as if the FMI provided the service. The expectations outlined below are specifically targeted at critical service providers and cover risk identification and management, robust information security management, reliability and resilience, effective technology planning, and strong communications with users. These expectations are written at a broad level, allowing critical service providers flexibility in demonstrating that they meet the expectations.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l142"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">Risk identification and management</p><h2 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A critical service provider is expected to identify and manage relevant operational and financial risks to its critical services and ensure that its risk-management processes are effective.</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A critical service provider should have effective processes and systems for identifying and documenting risks, implementing controls to manage risks, and making decisions to accept certain risks. A critical service provider may face risks related to information security, reliability and resilience, and technology planning, as well as legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to its corporate organisation and conduct, relationships with customers, strategic decisions that affect its ability to operate as a going concern, and dependencies on third parties. A critical service provider should reassess its risks, as well as the adequacy of its risk-management framework in addressing the identified risks, on an ongoing basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The identification and management of risks should be overseen by the critical service provider’s board of directors (board) and assessed by an independent, internal audit function that can communicate clearly its assessments to relevant board members. The board is expected to ensure an independent and professional internal audit function. The internal audit function should be reviewed to ensure it adheres to the principles of a professional organisation that governs audit practice and behaviour (such as the Institute of Internal Auditors) and is able to independently assess inherent risks as well as the design and effectiveness of risk-management processes and internal controls. The internal audit function should also ensure that its assessments are communicated clearly to relevant board members.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">Information security</p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A critical service provider is expected to implement and maintain appropriate policies and procedures, and devote sufficient resources to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information and the availability of its critical services in order to fulfil the terms of its relationship with an FMI.</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A critical service provider should have a robust information security framework that appropriately manages its information security risks. The framework should include sound policies and procedures to protect information from unauthorised disclosure, ensure data integrity, and guarantee the availability of its services. In addition, a critical service provider should have policies and procedures for monitoring its compliance with its information security framework.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This framework should also include capacity planning policies and change-management practices.

A critical service provider should have robust operations that meet or exceed the needs of the FMI. Any operational incidents should be recorded and reported to the FMI and the FMI’s regulator, supervisor, or overseer. Incidents should be analysed promptly by the critical service provider in order to prevent recurrences that could have greater implications. In addition, a critical service provider should have robust business continuity and disaster recovery objectives and plans. These plans should include routine business continuity testing and a review of these test results to assess the risk of a major operational disruption.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -42pt;text-align: justify;">Technology planning</p><h2 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The critical provider is expected to have in place robust methods to plan for the entire lifecycle of the use of technologies and the selection of technological standards.</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A critical service provider should have effective technology planning that minimises overall operational risk and enhances operational performance. Planning entails a comprehensive information technology strategy that considers the entire lifecycle for the use of technologies and a process for selecting standards when deploying and managing a service. Proposed changes  to  a  critical  service  provider’s  technology  should  entail  a  thorough  and comprehensive consultation with the FMI and, where relevant, its participants.

In particular, a critical service provider should provide the FMI and, where appropriate, its participants with sufficient information so that users clearly understand their roles and responsibilities, enabling them to manage adequately their risks related to their use of the services provided. Useful information for users typically includes, but is not limited to, information concerning the critical service provider’s management processes, controls, and independent reviews of the effectiveness of these processes and controls. As a part of its communication  procedures  and  processes,  a  critical  service  provider  should  have mechanisms to consult with users and the broader market on any technical changes to its operations that may affect its risk profile, including incidences of absent or non-performing risk controls of services. In addition, a critical service provider should have a crisis communication plan to handle operational disruptions to its services.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 200pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark552">&zwnj;</a>Annex G: Bibliography<a name="bookmark553">&zwnj;</a></h1><p style="padding-top: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BCBS, <i>The application of Basel II to trading activities and the treatment of double default effects, </i>April 2005.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 147%;text-align: left;">BCBS, <i>International convergence of capital measurement and capital standards</i>, June 2006.
